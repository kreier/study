# Data on the study project

When starting a project like "Read the entire bible" one might wonder how big of a project that is. The bible has 66 books, and in them 1189 verses. The [books_of_the_bible.csv](https://github.com/kreier/study/blob/main/data/books_of_the_bible.csv) contains a few details about them. But they are not all equal in size, as this image from [https://kreier.github.io/tripitaka/](https://kreier.github.io/tripitaka/) indicates:

Of course it is best to have a reading schedule. I tracked down our [organized schedules to the 70s](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kreier/study/refs/heads/main/data/midweek2025.pdf). And the pace changed several times. The 2000s say a speed up to completely read the whole bible in 5 years. With the new cycle that started on January 6th, 2020 it is greatly reduced. In 2025, after 5 years, we finished Psalms on February 10th. Thats 628 chapters so far (52.8 % of 1189 chapters) that would have required 2870 minutes (51.7% of 5553 %) listening. With so many highlights in the Greek scriptures to expect I think we're looking at a 10 year reading cycle that finishes at the end of 2030.

## Audio files

I created a summary Excel file [statistics.xlsx](https://github.com/kreier/study/raw/refs/heads/main/data/statistics.xlsx) in this folder to get more details. A small mistake in James gave the wrong total, but was fixed on September 8, 2023. The total number of minutes is 5553 in 2320 MByte of mp3 audio files. Look at this [chapters_audio.csv](https://github.com/kreier/study/blob/main/data/chapters_audio.csv) for details.

Just the old testament equals 4213 minutes. That equals 70 hours 13 minutes. Almost 3 days continuous reading or listening. If you manage 8 hours each day it would require almost 9 days. And for the **5553** minutes, that is **92 hours 33 minutes**, requires almost 12 days of 8 hours commitment each day. Within two weeks one should be able to read the entire bible.

## Statistics from KJV

- 66 books
- 1,189 chapters
- 31,102 verses
- 35,049 sentences
- 790,573 words
- 3,223,201 characters

### Comparison in [wpm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute)

While having a different dataset, reading 790,573 words in 5553 minutes equals 142 words per minute. The recommendation for audio books is stated as 150-160, and much higher than my current 71 wpm typing speed.
