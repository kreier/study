### Why Be Content and Modest?

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-19-25-2022/Why-Be-Content-and-Modest/)

- God’s prophet refused Jeroboam’s lavish gifts (1Ki 13:7-10; w08 8/15 8 ¶4)
- God’s prophet later disobeyed Jehovah’s direct command (1Ki 13:14-19; w08 8/15 11 ¶15)
- The prophet’s disobedience led to disaster (1Ki 13:20-22; w08 8/15 9 ¶10)

If we are content and look to Jehovah when making decisions, we can avoid many unforeseen problems.​—1Ti 6:8-10.
