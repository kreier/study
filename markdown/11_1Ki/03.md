### The Value of Wisdom

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-8-14-2022/The-Value-of-Wisdom/)

- Solomon asked Jehovah for wisdom (1Ki 3:7-9; w11 12/15 8 ¶4-6)
- Solomon’s request pleased Jehovah (1Ki 3:10-13)
- Because Solomon valued godly wisdom, the nation lived in security (1Ki 4:25)

A wise person combines knowledge with understanding and puts them to work in a practical way. Wisdom is more valuable than gold. (Pr 16:16) We can acquire wisdom by asking God for it, fearing him, being humble and modest, and digging into his Word.
