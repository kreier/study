### Choose Your Marriage Mate Wisely

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-12-18-2022/Choose-Your-Marriage-Mate-Wisely/)

- Solomon unwisely married women who worshipped false gods (1Ki 11:1, 2; w18.07 18 ¶7)
- Solomon’s wives gradually inclined his heart away from Jehovah (1Ki 11:3-6; w19.01 15 ¶6)
- Jehovah became furious at Solomon (1Ki 11:9, 10; w18.07 19 ¶9)

God’s Word counsels single Christians to marry “only in the Lord.” (1Co 7:39) Yet, baptism itself does not qualify someone as a suitable mate. Will the person help you to keep serving Jehovah whole-souled? Has the person shown a deep love for Jehovah over time? Before agreeing to marry, take time to get to know your prospective mate well.
