### Imitate How Jehovah Exercises Authority

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-17-23-2022/Imitate-How-Jehovah-Exercises-Authority/)

- Jehovah has supreme authority (1Ki 22:19; it-2 21)
- Jehovah honors those subject to him (1Ki 22:20-22; w21.02 4 ¶9)
- Jehovah blessed the work of an angel (1Ki 22:23; it-2 245)

Especially must elders and family heads try to imitate the way that Jehovah wields authority. (Eph 6:4; 1Pe 3:7; 5:2, 3) When they do so, those under their authority will be happy and content.
