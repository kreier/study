### Do You Learn From Your Mistakes?

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-1-7-2022/Do-You-Learn-From-Your-Mistakes/)

- Adonijah was shown mercy after ambitiously scheming to become king (1Ki 1:5, 52, 53; it-2 987 ¶4)
- Adonijah did not learn from his mistake and suffered the consequences (1Ki 2:15-17, 22, 23; it-1 49)

A wise person will learn from his mistakes. Even better, he will learn from the mistakes of others.​—1Co 10:11.

## 1 Kings 2

```
David instructs Solomon (1-9)
David dies; Solomon on the throne (10-12)
Adonijah’s plot leads to his death (13-25)
Abiathar banished; Joab killed (26-35)
Shimei killed (36-46)
```

#### 1Ki 2:37, 41-46​—What lesson can we learn from the mistake of Shimei? (w05 7/1 30 ¶1)

How dangerous it is to think that one can step out of bounds with impunity! Those who deliberately deviate from following ‘the cramped road leading off into life’ will suffer the consequences of that unwise decision.​—Matthew 7:14.

## 1 Kings 3

```
Solomon marries Pharaoh’s daughter (1-3)
Jehovah appears to Solomon in a dream (4-15)
  Solomon asks for wisdom (7-9)
Solomon judges between two mothers (16-28)
```

### The Value of Wisdom

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-8-14-2022/The-Value-of-Wisdom/)

- Solomon asked Jehovah for wisdom (1Ki 3:7-9; w11 12/15 8 ¶4-6)
- Solomon’s request pleased Jehovah (1Ki 3:10-13)
- Because Solomon valued godly wisdom, the nation lived in security (1Ki 4:25)

A wise person combines knowledge with understanding and puts them to work in a practical way. Wisdom is more valuable than gold. (Pr 16:16) We can acquire wisdom by asking God for it, fearing him, being humble and modest, and digging into his Word.

## 1 Kings 4

```
Solomon’s administration (1-19)
Prosperity under Solomon’s rule (20-28)
  Security under vine and fig tree (25)
Solomon’s wisdom and proverbs (29-34)
```

#### 1Ki 4:20​—What is significant about the expression “as numerous as the grains of sand by the sea”? (w98 2/1 11 ¶15)

With Abraham’s descendants organized as a nation under the Law, Jehovah blessed them according to his promise to the patriarch. In 1473 B.C.E., Moses’ successor, Joshua, led Israel into Canaan. The subsequent division of the land among the tribes fulfilled Jehovah’s promise to give the land to Abraham’s seed. When Israel was faithful, Jehovah fulfilled his promise to give them victory over their enemies. This was especially true during the rule of King David. By the time of David’s son Solomon, a third aspect of the Abrahamic covenant was fulfilled. “Judah and Israel were many, like the grains of sand that are by the sea for multitude, eating and drinking and rejoicing.”—1 Kings 4:20.

## 1 Kings 5

```
King Hiram provides building materials (1-12)
Solomon’s conscripted workforce (13-18)
```

### Built With Their Hands and Their Hearts

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-15-21-2022/Built-With-Their-Hands-and-Their-Hearts/)

- Solomon used the best building materials for the temple (1Ki 5:6, 17; w11 2/1 15)
- Many shared in the work (1Ki 5:13-16; it-1 424; it-2 1077 ¶1)
- Solomon and the people worked hard for seven years to complete the project (1Ki 6:38; see cover picture)

Solomon and the people were able to build a beautiful temple to Jehovah’s praise because their hearts were in the work. Sadly, enthusiasm for Jehovah’s worship faded with future generations. They allowed the temple to fall into disrepair, and eventually it was destroyed.

## 1 Kings 6

```
Solomon builds the temple (1-38)
  Innermost room (19-22)
  Cherubs (23-28)
  Engravings, doors, inner courtyard (29-36)
  Temple completed in about seven years (37, 38)
```

#### 1Ki 6:1​—What does this verse illustrate about the Bible? (g 5/12 17, box)

An example of the value of the Bible’s precise timekeeping is demonstrated at 1 Kings 6:1, which points to the time when King Solomon commenced work on the temple in Jerusalem. We read: *“It came about in the four hundred and eightieth year [479 full years] after the sons of Israel came out from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year [of Solomon’s reign], in the month of Ziv, that is, the second month, after Solomon became king over Israel, that he proceeded to build the house to Jehovah.”*

Bible chronology places the fourth year of Solomon’s reign at 1034 B.C.E. Counting back from that date 479 full years brings us to 1513 B.C.E. as the year of Israel’s Exodus.

## 1 Kings 7

```
Solomon’s palace complex (1-12)
Skilled Hiram to assist Solomon (13-47)
  The two copper pillars (15-22)
  The Sea of cast metal (23-26)
  Ten carriages and basins of copper (27-39)
Furnishings of gold completed (48-51)
```

#### 1Ki 7:23​—What lesson can we learn from the large “Sea of cast metal” that was constructed for the temple? (it-1 263)

Physical cleanliness is required of those who worship Jehovah in holiness and purity. This was demonstrated in connection with the tabernacle arrangement and the later temple service. At their installation, High Priest Aaron and his sons bathed before donning the official garments. (Ex 29:4-9; 40:12-15; Le 8:6, 7) To wash their hands and feet, the priests used water from the copper basin in the courtyard of the tabernacle and, later, from the huge molten sea at Solomon’s temple. (Ex 30:18-21; 40:30-32; 2Ch 4:2-6) On the Day of Atonement the high priest bathed twice. (Le 16:4, 23, 24) Those who took the goat for Azazel, the remains of the animal sacrifices, and the sacrificial red cow outside the camp had to bathe their flesh and wash their garments before reentering the camp.​—Le 16:26-28; Nu 19:2-10.

### What We Can Learn From Two Pillars

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-22-28-2022/What-We-Can-Learn-From-Two-Pillars/)

- Two conspicuous pillars were built for the porch of the temple (1Ki 7:15, 16; w13 12/1 13 ¶3)
- The pillars were given meaningful names (1Ki 7:21; it-1 348)
- Jehovah would help the people “firmly establish” the temple as long as they relied on him (1Ki 7:21, ftn.; Ps 127:1)

Jehovah may have helped us to overcome many obstacles in order to come into the truth. But we must continue to rely on him in order to “stand firm in the faith.”​—1Co 16:13.

## 1 Kings 8

```
The Ark brought into the temple (1-13)
Solomon addresses the people (14-21)
Solomon’s prayer of temple dedication (22-53)
Solomon blesses the people (54-61)
Sacrifices and dedication festival (62-66)
```

#### 1Ki 8:27​—What does Solomon’s statement not mean? (it-1 1060 ¶4)

Solomon, the constructor of the temple at Jerusalem, stated that the “heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens” cannot contain God. (1Ki 8:27) As the Creator of the heavens, Jehovah’s position is far above them all, and “his name alone is unreachably high. His dignity is above earth and heaven.” (Ps 148:13) Jehovah measures the physical heavens as easily as a man would measure an object by spreading his fingers so that the object lies between the tips of the thumb and the little finger. (Isa 40:12) Solomon’s statement does not mean that God has no specific place of residence. Nor does it mean that he is omnipresent in the sense of being literally everywhere and in everything. This can be seen from the fact that Solomon also spoke of Jehovah as hearing “from the heavens, your established place of dwelling,” that is, the heavens of the spirit realm.​—1Ki 8:30, 39.

### Solomon’s Humble, Heartfelt Public Prayer

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-29-September-4-2022/Solomons-Humble-Heartfelt-Public-Prayer/)

- At the temple inauguration, Solomon offered a heartfelt prayer in front of the people (1Ki 8:22; w09 11/15 9 ¶9-10)
- Solomon praised Jehovah and did not draw attention to himself (1Ki 8:23, 24)
- Solomon prayed with a humble spirit (1Ki 8:27; w99 1/15 17 ¶7-8)

Solomon provides a good example, especially for those who pray publicly. We should focus more on how we sound to Jehovah than on how we sound to people.

## 1 Kings 9

```
Jehovah appears to Solomon again (1-9)
Solomon’s gift to King Hiram (10-14)
Diverse projects of Solomon (15-28)
```

## 1 Kings 10

```
Queen of Sheba visits Solomon (1-13)
Solomon’s great wealth (14-29)
```

#### 1Ki 10:10, 14​—What evidence shows that the amount of gold that King Solomon possessed was not exaggerated? (w08 11/1 22 ¶4-6)

The Scriptures say that Hiram, king of Tyre, sent four tons [4 t] of gold to Solomon, the queen of Sheba gave him a similar amount, and Solomon’s fleet brought over 15 tons [14 t] of gold from Ophir. “The weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year,” says the account, “amounted up to six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,” or more than 25 tons [22 t]. (1 Kings 9:14, 28; 10:10, 14) Is this plausible? How big were royal gold reserves in antiquity?

An ancient inscription, which scholars judge as credible, states that Pharaoh Thutmose III of Egypt (second millennium B.C.E.) presented some 13.5 tons [12 t] of gold to the temple of Amun-Ra at Karnak. During the eighth century B.C.E., the Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser III received over 4 tons [4 t] of gold in tribute from Tyre, and Sargon II gave the same amount of gold as a gift to the gods of Babylon. King Philip II of Macedonia (359-336 B.C.E.) is reported to have extracted more than 28 tons [25 t] of gold each year from the mines of Pangaeum in Thrace.

When Philip’s son Alexander the Great (336-323 B.C.E.) captured the Persian city of Susa, he is said to have taken some 1,180 tons [1,070 t] of gold from it and almost 7,000 tons [more than 6,000 t] from the whole of Persia. So when compared with these reports, the Bible’s description of King Solomon’s gold is not exaggerated.

### Praise Jehovah for His Wisdom

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-5-11-2022/Praise-Jehovah-for-His-Wisdom/)

- Jehovah gave Solomon extraordinary wisdom (1Ki 10:1-3; w99 7/1 30 ¶6)
- The queen of Sheba was astounded by the wisdom Jehovah gave Solomon (1Ki 10:4, 5; w99 11/1 20 ¶6)
- The queen of Sheba praised Jehovah for appointing Solomon as king (1Ki 10:6-9; w99 7/1 30-31)

Like the queen of Sheba, we can show appreciation for God-given wisdom. How? One way is by applying Jesus’ teachings in our life and doing our best to imitate his example. (Mt 12:42; 1Pe 2:21) Another way is to share godly wisdom with others in our ministry.

## 1 Kings 11

```
Solomon’s wives incline his heart (1-13)
Resisters against Solomon (14-25)
Jeroboam promised ten tribes (26-40)
Solomon dies; Rehoboam made king (41-43)
```

### Choose Your Marriage Mate Wisely

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-12-18-2022/Choose-Your-Marriage-Mate-Wisely/)

- Solomon unwisely married women who worshipped false gods (1Ki 11:1, 2; w18.07 18 ¶7)
- Solomon’s wives gradually inclined his heart away from Jehovah (1Ki 11:3-6; w19.01 15 ¶6)
- Jehovah became furious at Solomon (1Ki 11:9, 10; w18.07 19 ¶9)

God’s Word counsels single Christians to marry “only in the Lord.” (1Co 7:39) Yet, baptism itself does not qualify someone as a suitable mate. Will the person help you to keep serving Jehovah whole-souled? Has the person shown a deep love for Jehovah over time? Before agreeing to marry, take time to get to know your prospective mate well.

## 1 Kings 12

```
Rehoboam’s harsh reply (1-15)
Ten tribes revolt (16-19)
Jeroboam made king of Israel (20)
Rehoboam not to fight against Israel (21-24)
Jeroboam’s calf worship (25-33)
```

#### 1Ki 12:21-24​—What lesson do we learn from King Rehoboam’s obedience? (w18.06 14 ¶1-4)

In response to the revolt, Rehoboam mustered his army. But Jehovah intervened through the prophet Shemaiah, saying: “You must not go up and fight against your Israelite brothers. Each one of you must return to his house, for I have caused this to happen.”​—1 Ki. 12:21-24. *

Not even put up a fight? You can imagine how that would have troubled Rehoboam! What would people think of the king who threatened to punish his subjects “with scourges” yet soon yielded to this flagrant rebellion? (Compare 2 Chronicles 13:7.) Nevertheless, the king and his armies “obeyed the word of Jehovah and went back home, as Jehovah had told them.”

What is the lesson for us? It is wise to obey God even if doing so might expose us to some ridicule. Obedience to God leads to his favor and blessing.​—Deut. 28:2.

What was the result for Rehoboam? Obediently abandoning his plan to fight the newly established nation, he turned his attention to building cities in the tribal territories of Judah and Benjamin over which he still reigned. He reinforced a number of cities “to a very great degree.” (2 Chron. 11:5-12) More important, for a time he adhered to Jehovah’s laws. As the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel under Jeroboam sank into idolatry, many from there “supported Rehoboam” by traveling to Jerusalem to take their stand for true worship. (2 Chron. 11:16, 17) Thus, Rehoboam’s obedience strengthened his kingship.

## 1 Kings 13

```
Prophecy against the altar at Bethel (1-10)
  Altar ripped apart (5)
The man of God is disobedient (11-34)
```

### Why Be Content and Modest?

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-19-25-2022/Why-Be-Content-and-Modest/)

- God’s prophet refused Jeroboam’s lavish gifts (1Ki 13:7-10; w08 8/15 8 ¶4)
- God’s prophet later disobeyed Jehovah’s direct command (1Ki 13:14-19; w08 8/15 11 ¶15)
- The prophet’s disobedience led to disaster (1Ki 13:20-22; w08 8/15 9 ¶10)

If we are content and look to Jehovah when making decisions, we can avoid many unforeseen problems.​—1Ti 6:8-10.

## 1 Kings 14

```
Ahijah’s prophecy against Jeroboam (1-20)
Rehoboam reigns over Judah (21-31)
  Shishak’s invasion (25, 26)
```

#### 1Ki 14:13​—What does this verse teach us about Jehovah? (w10 7/1 29 ¶5)

Most important, the words of 1 Kings 14:13 teach us something beautiful about Jehovah and what he looks for in us. Recall that something good was “found in” Abijah. Jehovah evidently searched through Abijah’s heart until He found a trace of goodness. Compared to his family, Abijah was, as one scholar put it, the lone pearl “in a heap of pebbles.” Jehovah cherished this goodness and rewarded it, granting a measure of mercy to this one member of a wicked family.

## 1 Kings 15

```
Abijam, king of Judah (1-8)
Asa, king of Judah (9-24)
Nadab, king of Israel (25-32)
Baasha, king of Israel (33, 34)
```

### Asa Acted Courageously—Do You?

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-26-October-2-2022/Asa-Acted-Courageously-Do-You/)

- Asa zealously defended pure worship (1Ki 15:11, 12; w12 8/15 8 ¶4)
- Asa courageously put his worship ahead of family ties (1Ki 15:13; w17.03 19 ¶7)
- Asa’s good qualities evidently outweighed his mistakes (1Ki 15:14, 23; it-1 184-185)

**ASK YOURSELF:** ‘Do I show zeal for pure worship? Do I stop associating with anyone, including a family member, who turns his back on Jehovah?’​—2Jo 9, 10.

## 1 Kings 16

```
Jehovah’s judgment against Baasha (1-7)
Elah, king of Israel (8-14)
Zimri, king of Israel (15-20)
Omri, king of Israel (21-28)
Ahab, king of Israel (29-33)
Hiel rebuilds Jericho (34)
```

#### 1Ki 16:34​—How does this verse strengthen faith in Jehovah’s prophetic word? (w98 9/15 21-22)

For example, read the prophecy about the penalty for rebuilding Jericho and then consider its fulfillment. Joshua 6:26 states: “Joshua had an oath pronounced at that particular time, saying: ‘Cursed may the man be before Jehovah who gets up and does build this city, even Jericho. At the forfeit of his firstborn let him lay the foundation of it, and at the forfeit of his youngest let him put up its doors.’” Fulfillment came some 500 years later, for we read at 1 Kings 16:34: “In [King Ahab’s] days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho. At the forfeit of Abiram his firstborn he laid the foundation of it, and at the forfeit of Segub his youngest he put up its doors, according to Jehovah’s word that he spoke by means of Joshua the son of Nun.” Only a real God could inspire such prophecies and see to their fulfillment.

## 1 Kings 17

```
The prophet Elijah foretells a drought (1)
Elijah fed by ravens (2-7)
Elijah visits a widow in Zarephath (8-16)
Widow’s son dies and is raised (17-24)
```

## 1 Kings 18

```
Elijah meets Obadiah and Ahab (1-18)
Elijah versus the Baal prophets at Carmel (19-40)
  ‘Limping between two opinions’ (21)
The three-and-a-half-year drought ends (41-46)
```

#### 1Ki 18:1​—Why did Jesus say that the drought in Elijah’s day lasted “three years and six months”? (Lu 4:25; w08 4/1 19, box)

Jehovah’s prophet Elijah announced to King Ahab that the long drought would end soon. That happened “in the third year”​—evidently counting from the day Elijah first announced the drought. (1 Kings 18:1) Jehovah sent rain soon after Elijah said that He would. Some might conclude, then, that the drought ended during the course of its third year and that it was therefore less than three years long. However, both Jesus and James tell us that the drought lasted “three years and six months.” (Luke 4:25; James 5:17) Is this a contradiction?

Not at all. You see, the dry season in ancient Israel was quite long, lasting up to six months. No doubt Elijah came to Ahab to announce the drought when the dry season was already proving to be unusually long and severe. In effect, the drought had begun nearly half a year earlier. Thus, when Elijah announced the end of the drought “in the third year” from his previous announcement, the drought had already lasted nearly three and a half years. The full “three years and six months” had elapsed by the time all the people assembled to witness the great test on Mount Carmel.

Consider, then, the timing of Elijah’s first visit to Ahab. The people believed that Baal was “the rider of the clouds,” the god who would bring rains to end the dry season. If the dry season was unusually long, people likely wondered: ‘Where is Baal? When will he bring the rains?’ Elijah’s announcement that neither rain nor dew would occur until he said so must have been devastating to those Baal worshippers.​—1 Kings 17:1.

### “How Long Will You Be Limping Between Two Different Opinions?”

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-3-9-2022/How-Long-Will-You-Be-Limping-Between-Two-Different-Opinions/)

- Elijah challenged the Israelites to act decisively (1Ki 18:21; w17.03 14 ¶6)
- Baal was a lifeless god (1Ki 18:25-29; ia 88 ¶15)
- Jehovah proved his own godship in a dramatic way (1Ki 18:36-38; ia 90 ¶18)

Elijah called on the people to prove their faith by obeying Jehovah’s Law. (De 13:5-10; 1Ki 18:40) Today, we prove our faith and godly devotion by strictly obeying Jehovah’s commands.

## 1 Kings 19

```
Elijah flees Jezebel’s wrath (1-8)
Jehovah appears to Elijah at Horeb (9-14)
Elijah to anoint Hazael, Jehu, Elisha (15-18)
Elisha appointed to succeed Elijah (19-21)
```

#### 1Ki 19:19-21​—What does this account teach us about accepting a new assignment of sacred service? (w97 11/1 31 ¶2)

When extended the invitation to special service with Elijah, Elisha immediately left his field to minister to Israel’s foremost prophet. Evidently, some of his duties were menial, for he became known as the one who “poured out water upon the hands of Elijah.”c (2 Kings 3:11) Nevertheless, Elisha viewed his work as a privilege, and he stuck loyally by Elijah’s side.

Many of God’s servants today display a similar spirit of self-sacrifice. Some have left their “fields,” their livelihoods, to preach the good news in distant territories or to serve as members of a Bethel family. Others have traveled to foreign lands to work on the Society’s construction projects. Many have accepted what might be called lowly tasks. Yet, no one who slaves for Jehovah is performing an insignificant service. Jehovah appreciates all who serve him willingly, and he will bless their spirit of self-sacrifice.—Mark 10:29, 30.

### Look to Jehovah for Comfort

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-10-16-2022/Look-to-Jehovah-for-Comfort/)

- Elijah became afraid and ran for his life (1Ki 19:3, 4; w19.06 15 ¶5)
- Jehovah gave him practical assistance and showed him awe-inspiring displays of power (1Ki 19:5-7, 11, 12; ia 103 ¶13; 106 ¶21)
- Jehovah gave him work to do (1Ki 19:15-18; ia 106 ¶22)

Jehovah speaks to us today through the pages of his Word, reminding us that he truly cares for us and that he gives us meaningful work to do in his service.​—1Co 15:58; Col 3:23.

## 1 Kings 20

```
Syrians wage war against Ahab (1-12)
Ahab defeats the Syrians (13-34)
A prophecy against Ahab (35-43)
```

## 1 Kings 21

```
Ahab covets Naboth’s vineyard (1-4)
Jezebel maneuvers Naboth’s death (5-16)
Elijah’s message against Ahab (17-26)
Ahab humbles himself (27-29)
```

#### 1Ki 21:27-29​—How do we know that Ahab’s actions did not indicate true repentance? (w21.10 3 ¶4-6)

Finally, Jehovah’s patience came to an end. He sent Elijah to pronounce sentence on Ahab and Jezebel. Their entire family line was to be wiped out. Elijah’s words hit Ahab hard! Surprisingly, that arrogant man “humbled himself.”​—1 Ki. 21:19-29.

Although Ahab humbled himself on that occasion, his conduct afterward showed that he was not truly repentant. He did not try to remove Baal worship from his kingdom. And he did not promote the worship of Jehovah. Ahab showed his lack of repentance in other ways as well.

Later, when Ahab invited good King Jehoshaphat of Judah to join him in the war against the Syrians, Jehoshaphat suggested that they first consult a prophet of Jehovah. Initially, Ahab rejected the idea, saying: “There is still one more man through whom we can inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good things concerning me, only bad.” Even so, they consulted the prophet Micaiah. Sure enough, the man of God foretold bad news for Ahab! Rather than repentantly seek Jehovah’s forgiveness, wicked Ahab had the prophet thrown into prison. (1 Ki. 22:7-9, 23, 27) Although the king managed to imprison Jehovah’s prophet, he could not prevent the prophecy from coming true. In the battle that followed, Ahab was killed.​—1 Ki. 22:34-38.

## 1 Kings 22

```
Jehoshaphat’s alliance with Ahab (1-12)
Micaiah’s prophecy of defeat (13-28)
  A deceptive spirit to fool Ahab (21, 22)
Ahab killed at Ramoth-gilead (29-40)
Jehoshaphat’s reign over Judah (41-50)
Ahaziah king of Israel (51-53)
```

### Imitate How Jehovah Exercises Authority

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-17-23-2022/Imitate-How-Jehovah-Exercises-Authority/)

- Jehovah has supreme authority (1Ki 22:19; it-2 21)
- Jehovah honors those subject to him (1Ki 22:20-22; w21.02 4 ¶9)
- Jehovah blessed the work of an angel (1Ki 22:23; it-2 245)

Especially must elders and family heads try to imitate the way that Jehovah wields authority. (Eph 6:4; 1Pe 3:7; 5:2, 3) When they do so, those under their authority will be happy and content.
