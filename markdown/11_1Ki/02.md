## 1 Kings 2

```
David instructs Solomon (1-9)
David dies; Solomon on the throne (10-12)
Adonijah’s plot leads to his death (13-25)
Abiathar banished; Joab killed (26-35)
Shimei killed (36-46)
```

#### 1Ki 2:37, 41-46​—What lesson can we learn from the mistake of Shimei? (w05 7/1 30 ¶1)

How dangerous it is to think that one can step out of bounds with impunity! Those who deliberately deviate from following ‘the cramped road leading off into life’ will suffer the consequences of that unwise decision.​—Matthew 7:14.
