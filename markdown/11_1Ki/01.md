### Do You Learn From Your Mistakes?

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-1-7-2022/Do-You-Learn-From-Your-Mistakes/)

- Adonijah was shown mercy after ambitiously scheming to become king (1Ki 1:5, 52, 53; it-2 987 ¶4)
- Adonijah did not learn from his mistake and suffered the consequences (1Ki 2:15-17, 22, 23; it-1 49)

A wise person will learn from his mistakes. Even better, he will learn from the mistakes of others.​—1Co 10:11.
