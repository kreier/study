### Asa Acted Courageously—Do You?

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-26-October-2-2022/Asa-Acted-Courageously-Do-You/)

- Asa zealously defended pure worship (1Ki 15:11, 12; w12 8/15 8 ¶4)
- Asa courageously put his worship ahead of family ties (1Ki 15:13; w17.03 19 ¶7)
- Asa’s good qualities evidently outweighed his mistakes (1Ki 15:14, 23; it-1 184-185)

**ASK YOURSELF:** ‘Do I show zeal for pure worship? Do I stop associating with anyone, including a family member, who turns his back on Jehovah?’​—2Jo 9, 10.
