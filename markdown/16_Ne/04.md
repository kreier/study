#### Ne 4:17, 18​—How could a man do the work of rebuilding with just one hand? (w06 2/1 9 ¶1)

For burden bearers this would not be a problem. Once the load was placed on their head or shoulders, they could easily balance it with one hand “while the other hand was holding the missile.” The builders who needed both hands to do their work “were girded, each one with his sword upon his hip, while building.” They were ready to go into action in case of an enemy attack.
