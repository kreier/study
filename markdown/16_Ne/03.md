### Is Manual Work Beneath You?

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-31-August-6-2023/Is-Manual-Work-Beneath-You/)

- The high priest and his brothers did not view themselves as too important to share in rebuilding Jerusalem’s walls (Ne 3:1)
- Some prominent men refused to “lower themselves” to help with the repair work (Ne 3:5; w06 2/1 10 ¶1)
- God-fearing women willingly shared in the physically demanding project (Ne 3:12; w19.10 23 ¶11)

Many tasks that must be performed in the congregation involve manual or menial work and may occur behind the scenes.​—w04 8/1 18 ¶16.
