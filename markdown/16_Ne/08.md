## Nehemiah 8

```
The Law is read and explained to the people (1-12)
Festival of Booths observed (13-18)
```

#### Ne 8:2, 8​—If those in attendance “could listen with understanding” to the reading of the Law, why did the Levites also explain it? (it-1 145 ¶2)

A number of years after the Jews returned from Babylonian exile Ezra the priest read the book of the Law to Jews assembled in Jerusalem, and various Levites explained it to the people, Nehemiah 8:8 stating: “They continued reading aloud from the book, from the law of the true God, it being expounded, and there being a putting of meaning into it; and they continued giving understanding in the reading.” This expounding or interpreting may have involved paraphrasing the Hebrew text into Aramaic, Aramaic possibly having been adopted by the Hebrews when in Babylon. The expounding also, no doubt, involved exposition so that the Jews, even if understanding the Hebrew, would comprehend the deep significance of what was being read.
