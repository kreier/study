#### Ne 13:10​—Since temple singers were Levites, why were they listed separately? (it-2 452 ¶9)

Considerable importance was attached to the singing at the temple. This is evident from the many Scriptural references to the singers as well as from the fact that they were “set free from  duty” common to other Levites in order to devote themselves wholly to their service. (1Ch 9:33) Their continuance as a special group of Levites is emphasized by their being listed separately among those returning from Babylon. (Ezr 2:40, 41) Even the authority of the Persian king Artaxerxes (Longimanus) was brought to bear in their behalf, exempting them, along with other special groups, from ‘tax, tribute, and toll.’ (Ezr 7:24) Later, the king commanded that there was to be “a fixed provision for the singers as each day required.” Although Artaxerxes is credited with this order, most likely it was issued by Ezra on the basis of the power granted to him by Artaxerxes. (Ne 11:23; Ezr 7:18-26) Thus, it is understandable that, although the singers were all Levites, the Bible makes reference to them as a special body, speaking of “the singers and the Levites.”​—Ne 7:1; 13:10.

### Be Loyal to Jehovah When Choosing Friends

- Ammonites and Moabites were not permitted to “enter the congregation” because of their history of opposition to God’s people (Ne 13:1, 2; it-1 95 ¶5)
- High Priest Eliashib allowed an Ammonite to make use of a dining hall in the temple (Ne 13:4, 5; w13 8/15 4 ¶5-6)
- Nehemiah showed loyalty to Jehovah by ending Eliashib’s arrangement with God’s enemy (Ne 13:7-9)

If we choose friends who do not love Jehovah, are we being loyal to Jehovah?​—w96 3/15 16 ¶6.
