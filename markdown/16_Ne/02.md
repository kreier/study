## Nehemiah 2

```
Nehemiah sent to Jerusalem (1-10)
Nehemiah inspects the city walls (11-20)
```

#### Ne 2:4​—Was this a last-minute prayer of desperation, and what is the lesson for us? (w86 2/15 25)

No, for Jerusalem’s devastated condition had been the subject of Nehemiah’s prayers “day and night” for quite some time. (1:4, 6) When afforded the opportunity to tell King Artaxerxes about his desire to rebuild Jerusalem’s walls, Nehemiah again prayed, thus doing what he already had done repeatedly. Jehovah’s favorable answer resulted in a commission to rebuild the city’s walls.

**Lesson for Us:** Nehemiah looked to Jehovah for direction. When faced with weighty decisions, we, too, should “persevere in prayer” and act in harmony with Jehovah’s guidance.​—Romans 12:12.

### “At Once I Prayed”

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-24-30-2023/At-Once-I-Prayed/)

- Nehemiah prayed before answering the king’s question (Ne 2:2-4; w08 2/15 3 ¶5)
- Nehemiah’s request was favorably heard by the king (Ne 2:5, 6)

**FOR MEDITATION:** What could we do if we are asked to give an impromptu explanation of our beliefs?​—be 177 ¶4.
