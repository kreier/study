#### 2Ch 36:15-17—Jehovah’s compassion and patience must not be taken for granted (w05 12/1 21 ¶7)

Jehovah is compassionate and patient. However, his compassion and patience are not limitless. People must respond favorably to the Kingdom-preaching work if they are to survive when Jehovah brings an end to this wicked system of things.
