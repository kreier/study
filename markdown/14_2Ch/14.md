### Rely On Jehovah—When?

from [workbook March–April 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-24-30-2023/Rely-On-Jehovah-When/)

- Asa relied on Jehovah to defeat a large army (2Ch 14:9-12; w21.03 5 ¶12)
- Asa later counted on the Syrians to defeat a smaller army (2Ch 16:1-3; w21.03 5 ¶13)
- Jehovah was displeased with Asa for not continuing to seek His help (2Ch 16:7-9)

We may rely on Jehovah when making life-altering decisions, but what about at other times? It is important to take notice of Jehovah in all our ways.​—Pr 3:5, 6; w21.03 6 ¶14.
