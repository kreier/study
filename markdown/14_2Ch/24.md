#### 2Ch 24:22​—How was Zechariah’s prophetic request fulfilled? (it-2 1223 ¶13)

Son of High Priest Jehoiada. After Jehoiada’s death, King Jehoash turned away from true worship, listening to wrong counsel rather than to Jehovah’s prophets. Zechariah, Jehoash’s cousin (2Ch 22:11), sternly warned the people about this, but instead of repenting, they stoned him in the temple courtyard. Zechariah’s dying words were: “Let Jehovah see to it and ask it back.” This prophetic request was granted, for not only did Syria do great damage to Judah but also Jehoash was killed by two of his servants “because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest.” The Greek *Septuagint* and the Latin *Vulgate* say that Jehoash was killed to avenge the blood of the “son” of Jehoiada. The Masoretic text and the Syriac *Peshitta*, however, read “sons,” possibly using the plural number to denote the excellence and worth of Jehoiada’s son Zechariah the prophet-priest.​—2Ch 24:17-22, 25.
