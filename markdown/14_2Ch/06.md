## 2 Chronicles 6

```
Solomon’s address to the people (1-11)
Solomon’s prayer of inauguration (12-42)
```

#### 2Ch 6:29, 30​—How can these words of Solomon’s prayer comfort us? (w10 12/1 11 ¶7)

We can draw comfort from Solomon’s prayer. Fellow humans may not fully understand our inner feelings​—our “own plague” and our “own pain.” (Proverbs 14:10) But Jehovah knows our heart, and he deeply cares about us. Pouring out our heart to him in prayer can make our burdens easier to bear. “Throw all your anxiety upon him,” says the Bible, “because he cares for you.”​—1 Peter 5:7.
