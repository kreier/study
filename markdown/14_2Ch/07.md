### “My Heart Will Always Be There”

from [workbook March–April 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-27-April-2-2023/My-Heart-Will-Always-Be-There/)

- Jehovah chose the temple for himself (2Ch 7:11, 12)
- Jehovah’s heart would always be there, indicating that he would be highly interested in what went on at this house associated with his name (2Ch 7:16; w02 11/15 5 ¶1)
- If the people stopped walking before Jehovah “with all their heart,” he would allow the temple to be destroyed (2Ch 6:14; 7:19-21; it-2 1077-1078)

At the time of the temple’s inauguration, the people likely thought their heart would always be at the temple. Sadly, the people gradually lost their enthusiasm for worshipping Jehovah.
