### Jehovah Rewards Courageous Acts

from [workbook May–June 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-May-15-21-2023/Jehovah-Rewards-Courageous-Acts/)

- Jehoshabeath and her husband, Jehoiada, protected Jehoash from Athaliah (2Ch 22:11, 12; w09 4/1 24 ¶1-2)
- Jehoiada courageously took action to make Jehoash king (2Ch 23:1-11, 14, 15; w09 4/1 24 ¶3-5)
- Jehoiada was given the exceptional honor of being buried with the kings (2Ch 24:15, 16; it-1 379 ¶5)

**FOR MEDITATION:** In what areas of my worship would I like to show more courage?
