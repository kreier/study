## 2 Chronicles 1

```
Solomon’s request for wisdom (1-12)
Solomon’s wealth (13-17)
```

#### 2Ch 1:11, 12​—What does this account teach us about our personal prayers? (w05 12/1 19 ¶6)

Solomon’s request showed Jehovah that gaining wisdom and knowledge was close to the king’s heart. Our prayers to God indeed reveal what is close to our heart. We are wise to analyze their content.

### King Solomon Makes an Unwise Decision

from [workbook March–April 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-20-26-2023/King-Solomon-Makes-an-Unwise-Decision/)

- Solomon accumulated horses and chariots from Egypt (De 17:15, 16; 2Ch 1:14, 17)
- People and cities were needed to accommodate Solomon’s new military divisions (2Ch 1:14; it-1 174 ¶5; 427)

Although the people prospered during a good part of Solomon’s reign, they revolted under King Rehoboam because he kept his father’s heavy burdens and added to them. (2Ch 10:3, 4, 14, 16) Our decisions always have consequences.​—Ga 6:7.
