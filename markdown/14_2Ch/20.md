- When threatened, Jehoshaphat and the people of Judah turned to Jehovah for help (2Ch 20:12, 13; w14 12/15 23 ¶8)
- Jehovah comforted his people and provided them with clear direction (2Ch 20:17)
- Jehovah saved his people because they put faith in him (2Ch 20:21, 22, 27; w21.11 16 ¶7)

When Gog attacks Jehovah’s people during the great tribulation, those who put faith in Jehovah and who trust those whom he is using to take the lead will have nothing to fear.​—2Ch 20:20.
