### Are You Benefiting Fully From God’s Word?

Josiah listened to God’s Word carefully (2Ch 34:18, 19; see cover picture). He made an earnest effort to understand the meaning of what he was hearing (2Ch 34:21; it-1 1157 ¶4). He acted on what he learned (2Ch 34:33; w09 6/15 10 ¶20)

**ASK YOURSELF**, "Am I quick to act on what I learn about Jehovah in his Word, the Bible?" (from the workbook May-June 2023)
