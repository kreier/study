### “All These Blessings Will . . . Overtake You”

from [workbook July–August 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-16-22-2021/All-These-Blessings-Will-Overtake-You/)

- Those who listen to Jehovah’s voice receive many blessings (De 28:1, 3-6; w10 12/15 19 ¶18)
- Jehovah’s blessings will overtake his obedient servants (De 28:2; w01 9/15 10 ¶2)
- Jehovah wants our obedience to be “with rejoicing and joy of heart” (De 28:45-47; w10 9/15 8 ¶4)

Jehovah’s obedient servants enjoy his abundant blessings right now and will soon be overtaken by his promised future blessings.
