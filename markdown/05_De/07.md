### “You Must Not Form Any Marriage Alliances With Them”

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-21-27-2021/You-Must-Not-Form-Any-Marriage-Alliances-With-Them/)

- Jehovah required the Israelites to marry only fellow believers (De 7:3; w12 7/1 29 ¶2)
- Jehovah wants his servants to avoid pain and heartache (De 7:4; w15 3/15 30-31)
- Jehovah’s viewpoint regarding marriage has not changed (1Co 7:39; 2Co 6:14; w15 8/15 26 ¶12)

**ASK YOURSELF**, ‘How does the requirement to marry “only in the Lord” benefit me?’
