### “What Is Jehovah Your God Asking of You?”

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-28-July-4-2021/What-Is-Jehovah-Your-God-Asking-of-You/)

- Obey Jehovah out of awe and love (De 10:12; w09 10/1 10 ¶3-4)
- Obedience leads to blessings (De 10:13; w09 10/1 10 ¶6)
- Jehovah wants us to draw close to him (De 10:15; cl 16 ¶2)

Jehovah does not force us to obey him. Rather, he wants us to love and obey him “from the heart.” (Ro 6:17) Those who choose to serve Jehovah enjoy the best way of life.
