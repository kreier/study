#### De 27:17​—Why did Jehovah’s Law prohibit moving a neighbor’s boundary marker? (it-1 360)

Jehovah’s law prohibited the moving back of boundary marks. (De 19:14; see also Pr 22:28.) In fact, cursed was the one moving back “the boundary mark of his fellowman.” (De 27:17) Since landholders generally were dependent upon the produce of their plots of ground, moving back a boundary mark would mean depriving another person of some of his means of sustenance. Doing this was equivalent to theft and was so viewed in ancient times. (Job 24:2) But there were unscrupulous persons who were guilty of such abuses, and princes of Judah in Hosea’s time were likened to those moving back a boundary.​—Ho 5:10.
