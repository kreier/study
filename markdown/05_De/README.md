# Deuteronomy

Written by Moses in the plains of Moab. The writing was completed 1473 B.C.E. The time covered is two months in 1473 B.C.E.

## Deuteronomy 1

```
Leaving Mount Horeb (1-8)
Chiefs and judges appointed (9-18)
Disobedience at Kadesh-barnea (19-46)
  Israel’s refusal to enter the land (26-33)
  Unsuccessful conquest of Canaan (41-46)
```

#### De 1:19; 2:7​—How did Jehovah care for his people during their 40-year trek through a “great and fearsome wilderness”? (w13 9/15 9 ¶9)

When the Israelites set out on what became a 40-year trek through a “fear-inspiring wilderness,” Jehovah did not give them specific details beforehand as to how he would direct, protect, and care for them. Still, he repeatedly demonstrated that they could trust in him and his instructions. Using a pillar of cloud by day and one of fire by night, Jehovah reminded the Israelites that he was backing them as he led them across that inhospitable terrain. (Deut. 1:19; Ex. 40:36-38) He also provided for their basic needs. “Their very garments did not wear out, and their feet themselves did not become swollen.” Indeed, “they lacked nothing.”—Neh. 9:19-21.

### “The Judgment Belongs to God”

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-May-31-June-6-2021/The-Judgment-Belongs-to-God/)

- Elders must “judge with righteousness” (De 1:16; w96 3/15 23 ¶1)
- Elders “must not be partial in judgment” (De 1:17; w02 8/1 9 ¶4)

How can we all show that we appreciate the elder arrangement?​—Heb 13:17; Jas 5:13-15

## Deuteronomy 2

```
Wandering in the wilderness for 38 years (1-23)
Victory over King Sihon of Heshbon (24-37)
```

**2:4-6, 9, 19, 24, 31-35; 3:1-6**​—Why did the Israelites annihilate some of the people who lived east of the Jordan but not others? Jehovah commanded Israel not to engage in strife with the sons of Esau. Why? Because they were the offspring of Jacob’s brother. The Israelites were not to molest or war against the Moabites and the Ammonites, for they were descendants of Abraham’s nephew Lot. However, the Amorite Kings Sihon and Og had no such claims to the land under their control. Hence, when Sihon refused to let the Israelites pass through and Og came to meet them in battle, Jehovah commanded the Israelites to demolish their cities, leaving no survivors. (from [w20040915](https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/w20040915/Highlights-From-the-Book-of-Deuteronomy/#p12))

## Deuteronomy 3

Introduction to the Law (44-49)
```

#### De 4:23​—What was the point of this prohibition? (w04 9/15 25 ¶3)

**Does the prohibition against making carved images mean that it is wrong to make representations of objects for artistic purposes?** No. The prohibition here was against making images for worship​—against ‘bowing down to idols and serving them.’ The Scriptures do not forbid carving sculptures or making paintings of objects for artistic purposes.​—1 Kings 7:18, 25.

### Jehovah’s Laws Are Wise and Just

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-7-13-2021/Jehovahs-Laws-Are-Wise-and-Just/)

- We show wisdom and understanding when we obey God’s laws (De 4:6; it-2 1140 ¶5)
- Many who observe our actions recognize the wisdom of God’s laws (De 4:6; w99 11/1 20 ¶6-7)
- Jehovah’s people enjoy a way of life far superior to that of the nations (De 4:7, 8; w07 8/1 29 ¶13)

Many people are drawn to Jehovah’s organization when they see the fine conduct of those who live by God’s laws and principles.

## Deuteronomy 5

```
Jehovah’s covenant at Horeb (1-5)
The Ten Commandments restated (6-22)
The people’s fear at Mount Sinai (23-33)
```

#### De 5:21​—What does the law against covetousness teach us? (w19.02 22 ¶11)

Jehovah sees beyond a person’s outward appearance. He sees what we really are inside, in our heart. (1 Sam. 16:7) No thought, no feeling, no action can be kept secret from him. He looks for and encourages the good in us. But he wants us to identify and control wrong thoughts before they become wrong actions.​—2 Chron. 16:9; Matt. 5:27-30.

## Deuteronomy 6

```
Love Jehovah with all your heart (1-9)
  “Listen, O Israel” (4)
  Parents to instruct children (6, 7)
Do not forget Jehovah (10-15)
Do not put Jehovah to the test (16-19)
Tell the next generation (20-25)

### Train Your Children to Love Jehovah

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-14-20-2021/Train-Your-Children-to-Love-Jehovah/)

- Parents must cultivate their own love for Jehovah (De 6:5; w05 6/15 20 ¶11)
- They must set a good example for their children (De 6:6; w07 5/15 15-16)
- They must teach their children often about Jehovah (De 6:7; w05 6/15 21 ¶14)

In addition to family worship, what are some occasions when you might help your children to develop love for Jehovah and his principles?

## Deuteronomy 7

```
Seven nations to be destroyed (1-6)
Why Israel was chosen (7-11)

### “You Must Not Form Any Marriage Alliances With Them”

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-21-27-2021/You-Must-Not-Form-Any-Marriage-Alliances-With-Them/)

- Jehovah required the Israelites to marry only fellow believers (De 7:3; w12 7/1 29 ¶2)
- Jehovah wants his servants to avoid pain and heartache (De 7:4; w15 3/15 30-31)
- Jehovah’s viewpoint regarding marriage has not changed (1Co 7:39; 2Co 6:14; w15 8/15 26 ¶12)

**ASK YOURSELF**, ‘How does the requirement to marry “only in the Lord” benefit me?’

## Deuteronomy 8

```
Blessings from Jehovah reviewed (1-9)
  “Not live by bread alone” (3)
Do not forget Jehovah (10-20)
```

#### De 8:3​—What can we learn from Jehovah’s provision of the manna? (w04 2/1 13 ¶4)

Our prayer for daily bread should also remind us of our need for daily spiritual food. Although very hungry after a long fast, Jesus resisted Satan’s temptation to turn stones into bread, saying: “It is written, ‘Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.’” (Matthew 4:4) Jesus here quoted the prophet Moses, who told the Israelites:  “[Jehovah] humbled you and let you go hungry and fed you with the manna, which neither you had known nor your fathers had known; in order to make you know that not by bread alone does man live but by every expression of Jehovah’s mouth does man live.” (Deuteronomy 8:3) The way in which Jehovah supplied the manna provided the Israelites not only with physical food but also with spiritual lessons. For one thing, they were to “pick up each his amount day for day.” If they gathered more than enough for the day, the remainder began to smell and breed worms. (Exodus 16:4, 20) Yet, this did not occur on the sixth day when they had to gather double the daily amount to cover their needs for the Sabbath. (Exodus 16:5, 23, 24) So the manna impressed upon their minds that they had to be obedient and that their lives depended not just on bread but on “every expression of Jehovah’s mouth.”

## Deuteronomy 9

```
Why Israel was given the land (1-6)
Israel provokes Jehovah four times (7-29)
  The golden calf (7-14)
  Moses intercedes (15-21, 25-29)
  Three more provocations (22)
```

#### De 9:1-3​—Although the sons of Anak were “great and tall,” why did the Israelites have no need to fear them? (it-1 103)

(Anʹa·kim) [Those of (Belonging to) Anak].

A race of people of extraordinary size who inhabited the mountainous regions of Canaan as well as some coastal areas, particularly in the S thereof. At one time three prominent men of the Anakim, that is, Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, resided at Hebron. (Nu 13:22) It was here that the 12 Hebrew spies first saw the Anakim, and 10 of the spies subsequently gave a frightening report of the experience, alleging that these men were descendants of the pre-Flood Nephilim and that, by comparison with them, the Hebrews were like “grasshoppers.” (Nu 13:28-33; De 1:28) Their great stature caused them to be used as a standard of comparison in describing even the giantlike men of the Emim and the Rephaim. Their strength apparently produced the proverbial saying: “Who can make a firm stand before the sons of Anak?”​—De 2:10, 11, 20, 21; 9:1-3.

## Deuteronomy 10

```
Two tablets remade (1-11)
What Jehovah requires (12-22)
  Fear and love Jehovah (12)
```

### “What Is Jehovah Your God Asking of You?”

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-28-July-4-2021/What-Is-Jehovah-Your-God-Asking-of-You/)

- Obey Jehovah out of awe and love (De 10:12; w09 10/1 10 ¶3-4)
- Obedience leads to blessings (De 10:13; w09 10/1 10 ¶6)
- Jehovah wants us to draw close to him (De 10:15; cl 16 ¶2)

Jehovah does not force us to obey him. Rather, he wants us to love and obey him “from the heart.” (Ro 6:17) Those who choose to serve Jehovah enjoy the best way of life.

## Deuteronomy 11

```
You have seen Jehovah’s greatness (1-7)
The Promised Land (8-12)
Rewards for obedience (13-17)
God’s words to be impressed on hearts (18-25)
“A blessing and a curse” (26-32)
```

#### De 11:29​—How, apparently, was this verse fulfilled? (it-1 925-926)

In harmony with instructions given by Moses, the tribes of Israel assembled at Mounts Gerizim and Ebal under Joshua’s direction shortly after their conquest of Ai. There the people heard the reading of the blessings they would receive if they obeyed Jehovah and the maledictions that awaited them if they disobeyed him. The tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin stood in front of Mount Gerizim. The Levites and the ark of the covenant were situated in the valley, and the other six tribes stood in front of Mount Ebal. (De 11:29, 30; 27:11-13; Jos 8:28-35) Apparently, the tribes stationed in front of Mount Gerizim responded to the blessings read in their direction, whereas the other tribes responded to the curses read in the direction of Mount Ebal. While it has been suggested that the blessings were read toward Mount Gerizim because of its greater beauty and fertility in contrast with rocky, largely barren Mount Ebal, the Bible does not furnish any information on this matter. The Law was read aloud “in front of  all the congregation of Israel, together with the women and the little ones and the alien residents who walked in their midst.” (Jos 8:35) This vast throng could hear the words from positions in front of either mountain. This was probably due, at least in part, to the excellent acoustics of the area.​—See EBAL, MOUNT.

## Deuteronomy 12

```
Worship at the place God chooses (1-14)
Allowed to eat meat but not blood (15-28)
Do not be entrapped by other gods (29-32)
```

### How Jehovah Wants to Be Worshipped

from [workbook July–August 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-5-11-2021/How-Jehovah-Wants-to-Be-Worshipped/)

- The Israelites were to obey, love, and serve Jehovah with all their heart and soul (De 11:13; it-2 1007 ¶4)
- Remnants of false worship were to be completely destroyed (De 12:2, 3)
- Everyone was to worship in one place (De 12:11-14; it-1 84 ¶3)

Jehovah wants his people to worship him whole-souled, to reject all false worship, and to be united.

#### De 14:21​—What can we learn from the prohibition in the Law not to boil a young goat in its mother’s milk? ([w06 4/1 31 Questions From Readers](https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/w20060401/Questions-From-Readers/))

This directive of the Mosaic Law, which appears three times in the Bible, can help us appreciate Jehovah’s sense of propriety, his compassion, and his tenderness. It also highlights his abhorrence of false worship.​—Exodus 34:26; Deuteronomy 14:21.

To boil a young goat or other animal in its mother’s milk would be contrary to Jehovah’s natural arrangement of things. God provided the mother’s milk to nourish the kid and help it grow. Cooking the kid in the milk of its own mother would, in the words of one scholar, display “a contempt of the relation which God has established and sanctified between parent and young.”

Further, some suggest that boiling a kid in its mother’s milk may have been a pagan ritual performed to produce rain. If that was the case, the prohibition would have served to protect the Israelites from the senseless and heartless religious practices of the nations surrounding them. The Mosaic Law specifically forbade the Israelites to walk in the statutes of those nations.​—Leviticus 20:23.

Finally, we see in this particular law Jehovah’s tender compassion. Actually, the Law contained a number of similar injunctions against cruelty to animals and safeguards against working contrary to the natural order of things. For instance, the Law included commands that prohibited sacrificing an animal unless it had been with its mother for at least seven days, slaughtering both an animal and its offspring on the same day, and taking from a nest both a mother and her eggs or offspring.​—Leviticus 22:27, 28; Deuteronomy 22:6, 7.

Clearly, the Law was not just a complex set of commands and prohibitions. Among other things, its principles help instill in us an elevated moral sensibility that truly reflects Jehovah’s marvelous qualities.​—Psalm 19:7-11.

## Deuteronomy 15

```
Debt canceled every seventh year (1-6)
Assisting the poor (7-11)
Release of slaves every seventh year (12-18)
  An awl through a slave’s ear (16, 17)
Firstborn animals sanctified (19-23)
```

### How the Law Demonstrated Jehovah’s Concern for the Poor

from [workbook July–August 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-12-18-2021/How-the-Law-Demonstrated-Jehovahs-Concern-for-the-Poor/)

- The poor and those who had no inheritance received help from the nation of Israel (De 14:28, 29; it-2 1110 ¶3)
- During the Sabbath year, Israelites who owed money were granted “a release” from their debt (De 15:1-3; it-2 833)
- In the seventh year of his servitude, an Israelite who had sold himself into slavery was set free and given a gift by his master (De 15:12-14; it-2 978 ¶6)

**ASK YOURSELF**, ‘In what practical ways can I show concern for Christians in need?’

## Deuteronomy 16

```
Passover; Festival of Unleavened Bread (1-8)
Festival of Weeks (9-12)
Festival of Booths (13-17)
Appointing judges (18-20)
Forbidden objects of worship (21, 22)
```

### Principles for Judging Righteously

from [workbook July–August 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-19-25-2021/Principles-for-Judging-Righteously/)

- Be impartial (De 16:18, 19; it-1 343 ¶5)
- Establish the facts (De 17:4-6; it-2 511 ¶7)
- Get help for difficult cases (De 17:8, 9; it-2 685 ¶6)

Elders must be careful to follow these principles when rendering judgment in the congregation.

## Deuteronomy 17

```
Sacrifices to be without defect (1)
Handling matters of apostasy (2-7)
Difficult judgment matters (8-13)
Guidelines for a future king (14-20)
  King to write a copy of the Law (18)
```

#### De 17:7​—Why did the Law require that the witnesses to a wrongdoing be the first to stone the guilty one? (it-1 787)

Under the Law, for the penalty of cutting off to be carried out, evidence had to be established at the mouth of at least two witnesses. (De 19:15) These witnesses were required to be the first to stone the guilty one. (De 17:7) This would demonstrate their zeal for God’s law and the purity of the congregation of Israel and would also be a deterrent to false, careless, or hasty testimony.

## Deuteronomy 18

```
Share of priests and Levites (1-8)
Occult practices forbidden (9-14)
A prophet like Moses (15-19)
How to identify false prophets (20-22)
```


## Deuteronomy 19

```
Bloodguilt and cities of refuge (1-13)
Boundary markers not to be moved (14)
Witnesses in court (15-21)
  Two or three witnesses required (15)
```

### Human Life Is Precious to Jehovah

from [workbook July–August 2021]()

- Cities of refuge were easy to access (De 19:2, 3; w17.11 14 ¶4)
- Cities of refuge helped to protect the Israelites from bloodguilt (De 19:10; w17.11 15 ¶9)
- Hating our brother can lead to bloodguilt (De 19:11-13; it-1 344)

**ASK YOURSELF**, ‘What are some ways to demonstrate that I have Jehovah’s viewpoint of life?’

## Deuteronomy 20

```
Rules for warfare (1-20)
  Exemptions from military service (5-9)
```


## Deuteronomy 21

```
Unsolved murders (1-9)
Marrying captive women (10-14)
Right of the firstborn (15-17)
A stubborn son (18-21)
A man hung on a stake accursed (22, 23)
```

#### De 21:19​—Why was the local court situated at the gate of a city? (it-1 518 ¶1)

The local court was situated at the gate of a city. (De 16:18; 21:19; 22:15, 24; 25:7; Ru 4:1) By “gate” is meant the open space inside the city near the gate. The gates were places where the Law was read to the congregated people and where ordinances were proclaimed. (Ne 8:1-3) At the gate it was easy to acquire witnesses to a civil matter, such as property sales, and so forth, as most persons would go in and out of the gate during the day. Also, the publicity that would be afforded any trial at the gate would tend to influence the judges toward care and justice in the trial proceedings and in their decisions. Evidently there was a place provided near the gate where the judges could comfortably preside. (Job 29:7) Samuel traveled in a circuit of Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah and “judged Israel at all these places,” as well as at Ramah, where his house was located.​—1Sa 7:16, 17.

## Deuteronomy 22

```
Respect for neighbors’ animals (1-4)
Wearing garments of the opposite sex (5)
Kindness to animals (6, 7)
Parapet for the roof (8)
Improper mixtures (9-11)
Tassels on clothing (12)
Laws on sexual violations (13-30)
```

### How the Law Demonstrated Jehovah’s Concern for Animals

from [workbook July–August 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-2-8-2021/How-the-Law-Demonstrated-Jehovahs-Concern-for-Animals/)

- An animal in distress was not to be ignored (De 22:4; it-1 375-376)
- A mother bird was not to be treated cruelly (De 22:6, 7; it-1 621 ¶1)
- Animals of different types were not to be yoked together (De 22:10; w03 10/15 32 ¶1-2)

The way we treat animals is important to Jehovah. We must not be cruel to animals or kill them just for sport.​—Pr 12:10.

## Deuteronomy 23

```
Those ineligible for God’s congregation (1-8)
Cleanliness of the camp (9-14)
Fugitive slaves (15, 16)
Prostitution forbidden (17, 18)
Interest and vows (19-23)
What passersby are allowed to eat (24, 25)
```

#### De 23:19, 20​—Why could interest be charged on a loan to a foreigner but not on a loan to a fellow Israelite? (it-1 600)

**Debt, Debtor** A debt refers to that which is owed, an obligation to pay or render something. In ancient Israel, debts were incurred primarily because of financial reverses. For an Israelite to become a debtor was a misfortune; the borrower, in effect, became the lender’s servant. (Pr 22:7) God’s people were therefore commanded to be generous and unselfish in lending to needy fellow Israelites, not seeking to profit from their adversity by charging them interest. (Ex 22:25; De 15:7, 8; Ps 37:26; 112:5) But foreigners could be required to pay interest. (De 23:20) Jewish commentators understand this provision to apply to business loans, not to cases of need. Ordinarily foreigners were in Israel only temporarily, often as merchants, and could reasonably be expected to pay interest, especially since they would also be lending to others on interest.

## Deuteronomy 24

```
Marriage and divorce (1-5)
Respect for life (6-9)
Showing concern for the poor (10-18)
Rules on gleaning (19-22)
```

#### De 24:1​—Why should we not conclude that the Mosaic Law made it easy for a man to divorce his wife? (it-1 640 ¶5)

**Certificate of Divorce.** It should not be concluded from the later abuses that the original Mosaic divorce concession made it easy for an Israelite husband to divorce his wife. In order to do so, he had to take formal steps. It was necessary to write a document, to “write out a certificate of divorce for her.” The divorcing husband had to “put it in her hand and dismiss her from his house.” (De 24:1) While the Scriptures do not provide additional details on this procedure, this legal step apparently involved consultation with duly authorized men, who might first endeavor to effect a reconciliation. The time involved in preparing the certificate and legally implementing the divorce would afford the divorcing husband opportunity to reconsider his decision. There would have to be a basis for the divorce, and when the regulation was properly applied, this would logically serve as a deterrent to rash action in obtaining divorces. Then, too, the wife’s rights and interests were thus protected. The Scriptures do not disclose the contents of the “certificate of divorce.”

### How the Law Demonstrated Jehovah’s Concern for Women

from [workbook July–August 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-9-15-2021/How-the-Law-Demonstrated-Jehovahs-Concern-for-Women/)

- Brides did not lose their husbands to the army during their first year of marriage (De 24:5; it-2 1196 ¶4)
- Widows were cared for materially (De 24:19-21; it-1 963 ¶2)
- Childless widows were given the opportunity to have children (De 25:5, 6; w11 3/1 23)

**ASK YOURSELF,** ‘How can I show consideration and respect for women in my family and congregation?’

## Deuteronomy 25

```
Flogging regulated (1-3)
Do not muzzle a threshing bull (4)
Brother-in-law marriage (5-10)
Improper grabbing in fights (11, 12)

## Deuteronomy 27

```
The Law to be written on stones (1-10)
At Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim (11-14)
The curses recited (15-26)
```

#### De 27:17​—Why did Jehovah’s Law prohibit moving a neighbor’s boundary marker? (it-1 360)

Jehovah’s law prohibited the moving back of boundary marks. (De 19:14; see also Pr 22:28.) In fact, cursed was the one moving back “the boundary mark of his fellowman.” (De 27:17) Since landholders generally were dependent upon the produce of their plots of ground, moving back a boundary mark would mean depriving another person of some of his means of sustenance. Doing this was equivalent to theft and was so viewed in ancient times. (Job 24:2) But there were unscrupulous persons who were guilty of such abuses, and princes of Judah in Hosea’s time were likened to those moving back a boundary.​—Ho 5:10.

## Deuteronomy 28

```
Blessings for obedience (1-14)
Curses for disobedience (15-68)
```

### “All These Blessings Will . . . Overtake You”

from [workbook July–August 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-16-22-2021/All-These-Blessings-Will-Overtake-You/)

- Those who listen to Jehovah’s voice receive many blessings (De 28:1, 3-6; w10 12/15 19 ¶18)
- Jehovah’s blessings will overtake his obedient servants (De 28:2; w01 9/15 10 ¶2)
- Jehovah wants our obedience to be “with rejoicing and joy of heart” (De 28:45-47; w10 9/15 8 ¶4)

Jehovah’s obedient servants enjoy his abundant blessings right now and will soon be overtaken by his promised future blessings.

## Deuteronomy 29

```
Covenant with Israel at Moab (1-13)
Warning against disobedience (14-29)
  Things concealed, things revealed (29)
```

#### De 29:4​—How are the Israelites a warning example for us? (it-1 665 ¶3)

Jehovah, through his servants, spoke of the stubborn, disobedient Israelites as having ‘uncircumcised ears.’ (Jer 6:10; Ac 7:51) They are as though stopped up with something that impedes hearing. They are ears that have not been opened by Jehovah, who gives ears of understanding and obedience to those who seek him but allows the spiritual hearing of the disobedient ones to become dulled. (De 29:4; Ro 11:8) The apostle Paul foretold a time when some professing to be Christians would apostatize from the true faith, not wanting to hear the truth of God’s Word, but desiring to have their ears “tickled” by things pleasing to them, and would therefore listen to false teachers. (2Ti 4:3, 4; 1Ti 4:1) Also, one’s ears may “tingle” because of hearing startling news, especially news of calamity.​—1Sa 3:11; 2Ki 21:12; Jer 19:3.

## Deuteronomy 30

```
Returning to Jehovah (1-10)
Jehovah’s commands not too difficult (11-14)

### Serving Jehovah Is Not Too Difficult

- Learning and obeying God’s commandments is not beyond our reach (De 30:11-14; w09 11/1 31 ¶2)
- Jehovah has given each one of us a choice (De 30:15; w09 11/1 31 ¶1)
- Jehovah urges us to choose life (De 30:19; w09 11/1 31 ¶4)

Serving Jehovah is not too difficult if we rely on him for direction and strength.

Where can you find good illustrations to use in your teaching?

## Deuteronomy 33

```
Moses blesses the tribes (1-29)
  Jehovah’s “everlasting arms” (27)
```

**33:1-29​**—Why was Simeon not specifically mentioned in the blessing with which Moses blessed the sons of Israel? This was because Simeon as well as Levi had acted “harshly,” and their anger was “cruel.” (Genesis 34:13-31; 49:5-7) Their inheritance was not quite the same as that of the other tribes. Levi received 48 cities, and Simeon’s portion was within Judah’s territory. (Joshua 19:9; 21:41, 42) Hence, Moses did not specifically bless Simeon. However, Simeon’s blessing was included in the general blessing to Israel.

## Deuteronomy 34

```
Jehovah shows Moses the land (1-4)
Death of Moses (5-12)
```
