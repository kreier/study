### Principles for Judging Righteously

from [workbook July–August 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-19-25-2021/Principles-for-Judging-Righteously/)

- Be impartial (De 16:18, 19; it-1 343 ¶5)
- Establish the facts (De 17:4-6; it-2 511 ¶7)
- Get help for difficult cases (De 17:8, 9; it-2 685 ¶6)

Elders must be careful to follow these principles when rendering judgment in the congregation.
