#### De 1:19; 2:7​—How did Jehovah care for his people during their 40-year trek through a “great and fearsome wilderness”? (w13 9/15 9 ¶9)

When the Israelites set out on what became a 40-year trek through a “fear-inspiring wilderness,” Jehovah did not give them specific details beforehand as to how he would direct, protect, and care for them. Still, he repeatedly demonstrated that they could trust in him and his instructions. Using a pillar of cloud by day and one of fire by night, Jehovah reminded the Israelites that he was backing them as he led them across that inhospitable terrain. (Deut. 1:19; Ex. 40:36-38) He also provided for their basic needs. “Their very garments did not wear out, and their feet themselves did not become swollen.” Indeed, “they lacked nothing.”—Neh. 9:19-21.

- Elders must “judge with righteousness” (De 1:16; w96 3/15 23 ¶1)
- Elders “must not be partial in judgment” (De 1:17; w02 8/1 9 ¶4)

How can we all show that we appreciate the elder arrangement?​—Heb 13:17; Jas 5:13-15
