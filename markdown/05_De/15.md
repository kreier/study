### How the Law Demonstrated Jehovah’s Concern for the Poor

from [workbook July–August 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-12-18-2021/How-the-Law-Demonstrated-Jehovahs-Concern-for-the-Poor/)

- The poor and those who had no inheritance received help from the nation of Israel (De 14:28, 29; it-2 1110 ¶3)
- During the Sabbath year, Israelites who owed money were granted “a release” from their debt (De 15:1-3; it-2 833)
- In the seventh year of his servitude, an Israelite who had sold himself into slavery was set free and given a gift by his master (De 15:12-14; it-2 978 ¶6)

**ASK YOURSELF**, ‘In what practical ways can I show concern for Christians in need?’
