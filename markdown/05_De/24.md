#### De 24:1​—Why should we not conclude that the Mosaic Law made it easy for a man to divorce his wife? (it-1 640 ¶5)

**Certificate of Divorce.** It should not be concluded from the later abuses that the original Mosaic divorce concession made it easy for an Israelite husband to divorce his wife. In order to do so, he had to take formal steps. It was necessary to write a document, to “write out a certificate of divorce for her.” The divorcing husband had to “put it in her hand and dismiss her from his house.” (De 24:1) While the Scriptures do not provide additional details on this procedure, this legal step apparently involved consultation with duly authorized men, who might first endeavor to effect a reconciliation. The time involved in preparing the certificate and legally implementing the divorce would afford the divorcing husband opportunity to reconsider his decision. There would have to be a basis for the divorce, and when the regulation was properly applied, this would logically serve as a deterrent to rash action in obtaining divorces. Then, too, the wife’s rights and interests were thus protected. The Scriptures do not disclose the contents of the “certificate of divorce.”

- Brides did not lose their husbands to the army during their first year of marriage (De 24:5; it-2 1196 ¶4)
- Widows were cared for materially (De 24:19-21; it-1 963 ¶2)
- Childless widows were given the opportunity to have children (De 25:5, 6; w11 3/1 23)

**ASK YOURSELF,** ‘How can I show consideration and respect for women in my family and congregation?’
