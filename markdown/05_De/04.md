#### De 4:23​—What was the point of this prohibition? (w04 9/15 25 ¶3)

**Does the prohibition against making carved images mean that it is wrong to make representations of objects for artistic purposes?** No. The prohibition here was against making images for worship​—against ‘bowing down to idols and serving them.’ The Scriptures do not forbid carving sculptures or making paintings of objects for artistic purposes.​—1 Kings 7:18, 25.

- We show wisdom and understanding when we obey God’s laws (De 4:6; it-2 1140 ¶5)
- Many who observe our actions recognize the wisdom of God’s laws (De 4:6; w99 11/1 20 ¶6-7)
- Jehovah’s people enjoy a way of life far superior to that of the nations (De 4:7, 8; w07 8/1 29 ¶13)

Many people are drawn to Jehovah’s organization when they see the fine conduct of those who live by God’s laws and principles.
