### Human Life Is Precious to Jehovah

from [workbook July–August 2021]()

- Cities of refuge were easy to access (De 19:2, 3; w17.11 14 ¶4)
- Cities of refuge helped to protect the Israelites from bloodguilt (De 19:10; w17.11 15 ¶9)
- Hating our brother can lead to bloodguilt (De 19:11-13; it-1 344)

**ASK YOURSELF**, ‘What are some ways to demonstrate that I have Jehovah’s viewpoint of life?’
