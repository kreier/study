## Deuteronomy 33

```
Moses blesses the tribes (1-29)
  Jehovah’s “everlasting arms” (27)
```

**33:1-29​**—Why was Simeon not specifically mentioned in the blessing with which Moses blessed the sons of Israel? This was because Simeon as well as Levi had acted “harshly,” and their anger was “cruel.” (Genesis 34:13-31; 49:5-7) Their inheritance was not quite the same as that of the other tribes. Levi received 48 cities, and Simeon’s portion was within Judah’s territory. (Joshua 19:9; 21:41, 42) Hence, Moses did not specifically bless Simeon. However, Simeon’s blessing was included in the general blessing to Israel.

### Seek Refuge in Jehovah’s “Everlasting Arms”

- Jehovah wants us to remain morally upright (De 33:26; it-2 51)
- Jehovah willingly uses his strength in our behalf (De 33:27; rr 120, box)
- We should trust in Jehovah’s salvation as Moses did (De 33:29; w11 9/15 19 ¶16)

Jehovah’s everlasting arms support us during various trials. This includes when we are sick or depressed, face grief, or make mistakes but repent.
