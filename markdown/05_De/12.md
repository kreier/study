### How Jehovah Wants to Be Worshipped

from [workbook July–August 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-5-11-2021/How-Jehovah-Wants-to-Be-Worshipped/)

- The Israelites were to obey, love, and serve Jehovah with all their heart and soul (De 11:13; it-2 1007 ¶4)
- Remnants of false worship were to be completely destroyed (De 12:2, 3)
- Everyone was to worship in one place (De 12:11-14; it-1 84 ¶3)

Jehovah wants his people to worship him whole-souled, to reject all false worship, and to be united.
