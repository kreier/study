### How the Law Demonstrated Jehovah’s Concern for Animals

from [workbook July–August 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-2-8-2021/How-the-Law-Demonstrated-Jehovahs-Concern-for-Animals/)

- An animal in distress was not to be ignored (De 22:4; it-1 375-376)
- A mother bird was not to be treated cruelly (De 22:6, 7; it-1 621 ¶1)
- Animals of different types were not to be yoked together (De 22:10; w03 10/15 32 ¶1-2)

The way we treat animals is important to Jehovah. We must not be cruel to animals or kill them just for sport.​—Pr 12:10.
