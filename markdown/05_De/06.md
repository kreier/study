from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-14-20-2021/Train-Your-Children-to-Love-Jehovah/)

- Parents must cultivate their own love for Jehovah (De 6:5; w05 6/15 20 ¶11)
- They must set a good example for their children (De 6:6; w07 5/15 15-16)
- They must teach their children often about Jehovah (De 6:7; w05 6/15 21 ¶14)

In addition to family worship, what are some occasions when you might help your children to develop love for Jehovah and his principles?
