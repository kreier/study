### Serving Jehovah Is Not Too Difficult

from [workbook July–August 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-23-29-2021/Serving-Jehovah-Is-Not-Too-Difficult/)

- Learning and obeying God’s commandments is not beyond our reach (De 30:11-14; w09 11/1 31 ¶2)
- Jehovah has given each one of us a choice (De 30:15; w09 11/1 31 ¶1)
- Jehovah urges us to choose life (De 30:19; w09 11/1 31 ¶4)

Serving Jehovah is not too difficult if we rely on him for direction and strength.
