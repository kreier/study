### Why Be Humble?

from [workbook January–February 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-January-2-8-2023/Why-Be-Humble/)

- Josiah was eager to please Jehovah (2Ki 22:1-5)
- He humbly admitted the errors of the people (2Ki 22:13; w00 9/15 29-30)
- Because Josiah was humble, Jehovah blessed him (2Ki 22:18-20; w00 9/15 30 ¶2)

We gain Jehovah’s favor when we humbly turn to him for guidance and when we admit our mistakes and correct our path.​—Jas 4:6.
