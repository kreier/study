### Prayer Moved Jehovah to Intervene

from [workbook November–December 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-26-2022-January-1-2023/Prayer-Moved-Jehovah-to-Intervene/)

- Jehovah told Hezekiah that he would not recover from his sickness (2Ki 20:1; ip-1 394 ¶23)
- Faithful Hezekiah supplicated Jehovah (2Ki 20:2, 3; w17.03 21 ¶16)
- Hezekiah’s prayers moved Jehovah to intervene (2Ki 20:4-6; g01 7/22 13 ¶4)

Our prayers may move Jehovah to do what he might not have done otherwise. How does this account motivate you to persist in prayer?
