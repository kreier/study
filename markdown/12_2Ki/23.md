#### 2Ki 23:24, 25​—What encouragement does Josiah’s example provide for those who have endured a difficult childhood? (w01 4/15 26 ¶3-4)

Despite the negative circumstances of his early childhood, Josiah proceeded to do what was good in Jehovah’s eyes. So successful was his reign that the Bible states: “Like him there did not prove to be a king prior to him who returned to Jehovah with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his vital force, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him has there risen up one like him.”​—2 Kings 23:19-25.

What an encouraging example Josiah proves to be for those who may have had to endure a terrible childhood! What can we learn from his example? What helped Josiah to choose the right course and stay on it?
