### He Acted With Courage, Determination, and Zeal

- Jehovah gave Jehu a commission to eliminate the house of wicked King Ahab (2Ki 9:6, 7; w11 11/15 3 ¶2)
- Jehu acted promptly to execute King Jehoram (Ahab’s son) and Queen Jezebel (Ahab’s widow) (2Ki 9:22-24, 30-33; w11 11/15 4 ¶2-3; see the chart “‘The Whole House of Ahab Will Perish’​—2Ki 9:8”)
- Jehu completed his assignment, showing courage, determination, and zeal (2Ki 10:17; w11 11/15 5 ¶3-4)

**ASK YOURSELF,** ‘How can I imitate Jehu when fulfilling the commission at Matthew 28:19, 20?’
