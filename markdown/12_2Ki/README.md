# 2 Kings

Written by Jeremiah in Judah and Egypt. The writing was completed 580 B.C.E. The time covered is from c. 920 to 580 B.C.E.

## 2 Kings 1

```
Elijah foretells Ahaziah’s death (1-18)
```


## 2 Kings 2

```
Elijah taken up in a windstorm (1-18)
  Elisha gets Elijah’s official garment (13, 14)
Elisha heals Jericho’s water (19-22)
Bears kill young boys from Bethel (23-25)
```

#### 2Ki 2:11​—Where did Elijah go when he “ascended to the heavens in the windstorm”? (w05 8/1 9 ¶1)

These were neither the distant parts of the physical universe nor the spiritual place where God and his angelic sons dwell. (Deuteronomy 4:19; Psalm 11:4; Matthew 6:9; 18:10) “The heavens” to which Elijah ascended were the atmospheric heavens. (Psalm 78:26; Matthew 6:26) Racing through earth’s atmosphere, the fiery chariot evidently transferred Elijah to another part of the earth, where he continued living for a time. Years later, in fact, Elijah wrote a letter to Jehoram, the king of Judah.​—2 Chronicles 21:1, 12-15.

### A Fine Example of Training

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-24-30-2022/A-Fine-Example-of-Training/)

- Elisha watched as Elijah performed a miracle (2Ki 2:8; w15 4/15 13 ¶15; see cover picture)
- Elisha humbly used the fine training he received (2Ki 2:13, 14; w15 4/15 13 ¶16)

In the congregation, Jehovah entrusts the elders with the responsibility of training others. (2Ti 2:2) If the elders offer you training, be willing, reliable, and humble.

## 2 Kings 3

```
Jehoram, king of Israel (1-3)
Moab rebels against Israel (4-25)
Moab defeated (26, 27)
```


## 2 Kings 4

```
Elisha multiplies a widow’s oil (1-7)
A Shunammite woman’s hospitality (8-16)
Woman rewarded with a son; he dies (17-31)
Elisha resurrects the dead son (32-37)
Elisha makes stew edible (38-41)
Elisha multiplies bread (42-44)
```

#### 2Ki 4:38​—Who likely were “the sons of the prophets”? (it-2 697 ¶2)

**“Sons of the Prophets.”** As *Gesenius’ Hebrew Grammar* explains (Oxford, 1952, p. 418), the Hebrew *ben* (son of) or *benehʹ* (sons of) may denote “membership of a guild or society (or of a tribe, or any definite class).” (Compare Ne 3:8, where “a member of the ointment mixers” is literally “a son of the ointment mixers.”) “The sons of the prophets” may thus describe a school of instruction for those called to this vocation or simply a cooperative association of prophets. Such prophetic groups are mentioned as being at Bethel, Jericho, and Gilgal. (2Ki 2:3, 5; 4:38; compare 1Sa 10:5, 10.) Samuel presided over a group at Ramah (1Sa 19:19, 20), and Elisha seems to have held a similar position in his day. (2Ki 4:38; 6:1-3; compare 1Ki 18:13.) The record mentions their building their own dwelling place and the use of a borrowed tool, which may indicate that they lived simply. Though often sharing quarters and food in common, they might receive individual assignments to go out on prophetic missions.​—1Ki 20:35-42; 2Ki 4:1, 2, 39; 6:1-7; 9:1, 2.

### “Pick Up Your Son”

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-31-November-6-2022/Pick-Up-Your-Son/)

- The Shunammite woman showed exceptional hospitality to Elisha (2Ki 4:8-10)
- Jehovah blessed her with a son (2Ki 4:16, 17; w17.12 4 ¶7)
- Jehovah used Elisha to resurrect her son (2Ki 4:32-37; w17.12 4 ¶8)

Are you grieving the death of a child? Jehovah feels your pain. Very soon, he will bring your loved one back to life. (Job 14:14, 15) What a glorious day that will be!

## 2 Kings 5

```
Naaman healed of leprosy by Elisha (1-19)
Greedy Gehazi struck with leprosy (20-27)
```

#### 2Ki 5:15, 16​—Why did Elisha not accept Naaman’s gift, and what lesson can we learn? (w05 8/1 9 ¶2)

Elisha refused the gift because he recognized that the miracle of healing Naaman was performed by Jehovah’s power, not his own. It would have been unthinkable on his part to profit from his God-appointed office. True worshippers today do not reach out for personal gain from Jehovah’s service. They take to heart Jesus’ admonition: “You received free, give free.”​—Matthew 10:8.

## 2 Kings 6

```
Elisha makes axhead float (1-7)
Elisha versus the Syrians (8-23)
  Eyes of Elisha’s attendant opened (16, 17)
  Syrians mentally blinded (18, 19)
Famine in besieged Samaria (24-33)
```

### There Are More With Us Than With Them

from [workbook November–December 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-7-13-2022/There-Are-More-With-Us-Than-With-Them/)

- Elisha and his attendant were surrounded by the enemy (2Ki 6:13, 14; it-1 716 ¶4)
- Elisha remained calm and strengthened his attendant (2Ki 6:15-17; w13 8/15 30 ¶2; see cover picture)
- Jehovah miraculously saved Elisha and his attendant (2Ki 6:18, 19; it-1 343 ¶1)

Our opposers are not stronger than Jehovah. If we could peer into the spirit realm and see how Jehovah is using the angels to protect his people, what do you imagine we would see?

## 2 Kings 7

```
Elisha foretells end of famine (1, 2)
Food found at abandoned Syrian camp (3-15)
Elisha’s prophecy fulfilled (16-20)
```

### Jehovah Made the Unexpected Happen

from [workbook November–December 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-14-20-2022/Jehovah-Made-the-Unexpected-Happen/)

- During a severe famine, Jehovah said that food supplies would be abundant the next day (2Ki 7:1; it-1 716-717)
- An Israelite official scoffed at Jehovah’s promise (2Ki 7:2)
- Jehovah made the unexpected happen (2Ki 7:6, 7, 16-18)

Jehovah says that the destruction of this system will be sudden and unexpected. (1Th 5:2, 3) Why is it important for us to have faith in Jehovah’s word?

## 2 Kings 8

```
Shunammite woman’s land restored to her (1-6)
Elisha, Ben-hadad, and Hazael (7-15)
Jehoram, king of Judah (16-24)
Ahaziah, king of Judah (25-29)
```

#### 2Ki 8:19​—How did Jehovah give “a lamp” to David and his sons? (it-2 195 ¶7)

Jehovah God established King David on the throne of Israel, and David proved to be a wise guide and leader of the nation, under God’s direction. He was therefore called “the lamp of Israel.” (2Sa 21:17) In his kingdom covenant with David, Jehovah promised: “Your very throne will become one firmly established to time indefinite.” (2Sa 7:11-16) Accordingly, the dynasty, or family line, of rulers from David through his son Solomon was as a “lamp” to Israel.​—1Ki 11:36; 15:4; 2Ki 8:19; 2Ch 21:7.

## 2 Kings 9

```
Jehu anointed as king of Israel (1-13)
Jehu kills Jehoram and Ahaziah (14-29)
Jezebel killed; dogs eat her flesh (30-37)
```

### He Acted With Courage, Determination, and Zeal

from [workbook November–December 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-21-27-2022/He-Acted-With-Courage-Determination-and-Zeal/)

- Jehovah gave Jehu a commission to eliminate the house of wicked King Ahab (2Ki 9:6, 7; w11 11/15 3 ¶2)
- Jehu acted promptly to execute King Jehoram (Ahab’s son) and Queen Jezebel (Ahab’s widow) (2Ki 9:22-24, 30-33; w11 11/15 4 ¶2-3; see the chart “‘The Whole House of Ahab Will Perish’​—2Ki 9:8”)
- Jehu completed his assignment, showing courage, determination, and zeal (2Ki 10:17; w11 11/15 5 ¶3-4)

**ASK YOURSELF,** ‘How can I imitate Jehu when fulfilling the commission at Matthew 28:19, 20?’

## 2 Kings 10

```
Jehu kills the house of Ahab (1-17)
  Jehonadab joins Jehu (15-17)
Baal worshippers killed by Jehu (18-27)
Summary of Jehu’s reign (28-36)
```

#### 2Ki 10:29, 31​—What can we learn from Jehu’s error? (w11 11/15 5 ¶6-7)

Jehu may have believed that the independence of the kingdom of Israel from Judah required the religious separation of the two kingdoms. Hence, like former kings of Israel, he attempted to keep them separate by perpetuating calf worship. But this would show a lack of faith in Jehovah, who had made him king.

Jehovah commended Jehu because ‘he acted well in doing what was right in God’s eyes.’ Nevertheless, Jehu “did not take care to walk in the law of Jehovah the God of Israel with all his heart.” (2 Ki. 10:30, 31) Considering everything else that Jehu did earlier, you might find this surprising and sad. Yet, it does provide a lesson for us. We can never take our relationship with Jehovah for granted. Every day, we need to cultivate loyalty to God through study of his Word, meditation on it, and heartfelt prayer to our heavenly Father. Let us, therefore, exercise utmost care to keep on walking in Jehovah’s law with all our heart.​—1 Cor. 10:12.

## 2 Kings 11

```
Athaliah usurps the throne (1-3)
Jehoash secretly made king (4-12)
Athaliah killed (13-16)
Jehoiada’s reforms (17-21)
```

### An Ambitious, Wicked Woman Does Not Go Unpunished

from [workbook November–December 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-28-December-4-2022/An-Ambitious-Wicked-Woman-Does-Not-Go-Unpunished/)

- Athaliah murdered the royal offspring so that she could rule over Judah (2Ki 11:1; it-1 209; see the chart “‘The Whole House of Ahab Will Perish’​—2Ki 9:8”)
- Jehosheba hid Jehoash, the heir to the throne (2Ki 11:2, 3)
- High Priest Jehoiada installed Jehoash as king and executed wicked Athaliah, who was perhaps the last of Ahab’s house (2Ki 11:12-16; it-1 209)

**FOR MEDITATION:** How does this account illustrate the truthfulness of Proverbs 11:21 and Ecclesiastes 8:12, 13?

### “The Whole House of Ahab Will Perish”—2Ki 9:8

from [workbook November–December 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-28-December-4-2022/The-Whole-House-of-Ahab-Will-Perish-2Ki-98/)

[nice timeline - follow the link]

#### KINGDOM OF JUDAH

- **Jehoshaphat** is king
- **c. 911 B.C.E.: Jehoram** (son of Jehoshaphat; husband of Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel) becomes sole ruler
- **c. 906 B.C.E.: Ahaziah** (grandson of Ahab and Jezebel) becomes king
- **c. 905 B.C.E.: Athaliah** murders all the royal offspring and usurps the throne. Only her grandson Jehoash is saved and kept hidden from her by High Priest Jehoiada.​—2Ki 11:1-3
- **898 B.C.E.: Jehoash** becomes king. Queen Athaliah is executed by High Priest Jehoiada.​—2Ki 11:4-16

#### KINGDOM OF ISRAEL

- **c. 920 B.C.E.: Ahaziah** (son of Ahab and Jezebel) becomes king
- **c. 917 B.C.E.: Jehoram** (son of Ahab and Jezebel) becomes king
- **c. 905 B.C.E.: Jehu** executes King Jehoram of Israel and his brothers, Jehoram’s mother (Jezebel), and King Ahaziah of Judah and his brothers.​—2Ki 9:14–10:17
- **c. 904 B.C.E.: Jehu** begins ruling as king

## 2 Kings 12

```
Jehoash, king of Judah (1-3)
Jehoash repairs the temple (4-16)
Syrian invasion (17, 18)
Jehoash killed (19-21)
```

#### 2Ki 12:1​—Why is it significant that Jehovah preserved Jehoash alive? (it-1 1265-1266)

Thereafter, as long as High Priest Jehoiada lived and acted as father and adviser to Jehoash, the young monarch prospered. Married by the time he was 21, he had two wives, one of whom  was named Jehoaddan, and by these Jehoash became father to sons and daughters. In this way the line of David leading to the Messiah, which had come so near to being completely severed, was once again made strong.​—2Ki 12:1-3; 2Ch 24:1-3; 25:1.

## 2 Kings 13

```
Jehoahaz, king of Israel (1-9)
Jehoash, king of Israel (10-13)
Elisha tests Jehoash’s zeal (14-19)
Elisha’s death; his bones resurrect a man (20, 21)
Elisha’s final prophecy fulfilled (22-25)
```

#### 2Ki 13:20, 21​—Does this miracle support the veneration of religious relics? (w05 8/1 11 ¶3)

No, it does not. The Bible does not show that the bones of Elisha were ever venerated. It was God’s power that made this miracle possible, as was the case with all the miracles Elisha performed when he was still alive.

### Wholehearted Effort Results in Abundant Blessings

from [workbook November–December 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-5-11-2022/Wholehearted-Effort-Results-in-Abundant-Blessings/)

- Elisha instructed King Jehoash to take a certain action to illustrate how Israel would defeat Syria (2Ki 13:15-18)
- Because Jehoash was not wholehearted, his success was limited (2Ki 13:19; w10 4/15 26 ¶11)
- Jehovah abundantly blesses his servants who seek him earnestly (Heb 11:6; w13 11/1 11 ¶5-6)

**ASK YOURSELF,** ‘How do I demonstrate wholehearted effort in such aspects of my worship as Bible reading, meeting attendance, and the field ministry?’

## 2 Kings 14

```
Amaziah, king of Judah (1-6)
War with Edom and with Israel (7-14)
Death of Jehoash of Israel (15, 16)
Death of Amaziah (17-22)
Jeroboam II, king of Israel (23-29)
```


## 2 Kings 15

```
Azariah, king of Judah (1-7)
Israel’s last kings: Zechariah (8-12), Shallum (13-16), Menahem (17-22), Pekahiah (23-26), Pekah (27-31)
Jotham, king of Judah (32-38)
```


## 2 Kings 16

```
Ahaz, king of Judah (1-6)
Ahaz bribes the Assyrians (7-9)
Ahaz copies pagan altar (10-18)
Death of Ahaz (19, 20)
```


## 2 Kings 17

```
Hoshea, king of Israel (1-4)
Fall of Israel (5, 6)
Israel exiled because of apostasy (7-23)
Foreigners brought into Samaritan cities (24-26)
Samaritans’ mixed religion (27-41)
```

#### 2Ki 17:29​—Who were “the Samaritans” mentioned in this verse, and to whom did this term come to refer? (it-2 847)

The term “Samaritans” first appeared in Scripture after the conquest of the ten-tribe kingdom of Samaria in 740 B.C.E.; it was applied to those who lived in the northern kingdom before that conquest as distinct from the foreigners later brought in from other parts of the Assyrian Empire. (2Ki 17:29) It appears that the Assyrians did not remove all the Israelite inhabitants, for the account at 2 Chronicles 34:6-9 (compare 2Ki 23:19, 20) implies that during King Josiah’s reign there were Israelites still in the land. In time, “Samaritans” came to mean the descendants of those left in Samaria and those brought in by the Assyrians. Therefore some were undoubtedly the products of mixed marriages. At a still later period, the name carried more of a religious, rather than a racial or political, connotation. “Samaritan” referred to one who belonged to the religious sect that flourished in the vicinity of ancient Shechem and Samaria and who held to certain tenets distinctly different from Judaism.​—Joh 4:9.

### Jehovah’s Patience Has Limits

from [workbook November–December 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-12-18-2022/Jehovahs-Patience-Has-Limits/)

- Jehovah allowed Assyria to conquer Israel (2Ki 17:5, 6; it-2 908 ¶5)
- Jehovah disciplined his people because they kept offending him (2Ki 17:9-12; it-1 414-415)
- Jehovah was patient with Israel and warned them repeatedly (2Ki 17:13, 14)

Our loving heavenly Father is very patient with imperfect mankind. (2Pe 3:9) However, in order to accomplish his purpose, he will act to destroy the wicked very soon. How should this motivate us to listen to correction and to preach with urgency?

## 2 Kings 18

```
Hezekiah, king of Judah (1-8)
Review of Israel’s fall (9-12)
Sennacherib invades Judah (13-18)
The Rabshakeh taunts Jehovah (19-37)
```

### How Our Opposers Try to Weaken Us

from [workbook November–December 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-19-25-2022/How-Our-Opposers-Try-to-Weaken-Us/)

- Our opposers try to discourage us by lying about those taking the lead (2Ki 18:19-21; w05 8/1 11 ¶5)
- They try to mislead us by misrepresenting Jehovah or the organization (2Ki 18:22, 25; w10 7/15 13 ¶3)
- They try to tempt us by making false promises (2Ki 18:31, 32; w13 11/15 19 ¶14; yb74 177 ¶1)

**ASK YOURSELF,** ‘What steps can I take now to strengthen myself for persecution?’

## 2 Kings 19

```
Hezekiah seeks God’s help through Isaiah (1-7)
Sennacherib threatens Jerusalem (8-13)
Hezekiah’s prayer (14-19)
Isaiah conveys God’s answer (20-34)
Angel slays 185,000 Assyrians (35-37)
```

#### 2Ki 19:37​—How does this verse illustrate the importance of carefully weighing the reliability of archaeological discoveries? (it-1 155 ¶4)

As an illustration, the Bible record states that King Sennacherib of Assyria was killed by his two sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, and was succeeded to the throne by another son, Esar-haddon. (2Ki 19:36, 37) Yet, a Babylonian chronicle stated that, on the 20th of Tebeth, Sennacherib was killed by his son in a revolt. Both Berossus, Babylonian priest of the third century B.C.E., and Nabonidus, Babylonian king of the sixth century B.C.E., gave the same account, to the effect that Sennacherib was assassinated by only one of his sons. However, in a more recently discovered fragment of the Prism of Esar-haddon, the son who succeeded Sennacherib, Esar-haddon clearly states that his brothers (plural) revolted and killed their father and then took flight. Commenting on this, Philip Biberfeld, in *Universal Jewish History* (1948, Vol. I, p. 27), says: “The Babylonian Chronicle, Nabonid, and Berossus were mistaken; only the Biblical account proved to be correct. It was confirmed in all the minor details by the inscription of Esarhaddon and proved to be more accurate regarding this event of Babylonian-Assyrian history than the Babylonian sources themselves. This is a fact of utmost importance for the evaluation of even contemporary sources not in accord with Biblical tradition.”

## 2 Kings 20

```
Hezekiah’s sickness and recovery (1-11)
Messengers from Babylon (12-19)
Death of Hezekiah (20, 21)
```

### Prayer Moved Jehovah to Intervene

from [workbook November–December 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-26-2022-January-1-2023/Prayer-Moved-Jehovah-to-Intervene/)

- Jehovah told Hezekiah that he would not recover from his sickness (2Ki 20:1; ip-1 394 ¶23)
- Faithful Hezekiah supplicated Jehovah (2Ki 20:2, 3; w17.03 21 ¶16)
- Hezekiah’s prayers moved Jehovah to intervene (2Ki 20:4-6; g01 7/22 13 ¶4)

Our prayers may move Jehovah to do what he might not have done otherwise. How does this account motivate you to persist in prayer?

## 2 Kings 21

```
Manasseh, king of Judah; his bloodshed (1-18)
  Jerusalem to be destroyed (12-15)
Amon, king of Judah (19-26)
```

#### 2Ki 21:13​—In what sense would Jehovah use a leveling tool to measure Jerusalem? (it-2 240 ¶1)

A leveling instrument may be used to construct a building properly or to test its fitness for preservation. Jehovah foretold that he would apply to wayward Jerusalem “the measuring line applied to Samaria and also the leveling instrument applied to the house of Ahab.” God had measured and found Samaria and the house of King Ahab to be morally bad or crooked, resulting in their destruction. Likewise, God would judge Jerusalem and its rulers, exposing their wickedness and bringing about the destruction of that city. These events actually occurred in 607 B.C.E. (2Ki 21:10-13; 10:11) Through Isaiah the various wicked braggarts and rulers of the people in Jerusalem were apprised of their coming calamity and of Jehovah’s declaration: “I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the leveling instrument.” The standards of true justice and genuine righteousness would reveal who were really God’s servants and who were not, resulting in either preservation or destruction.​—Isa 28:14-19.

## 2 Kings 22

```
Josiah, king of Judah (1, 2)
Instructions for temple repair (3-7)
Book of the Law found (8-13)
Huldah’s prophecy of calamity (14-20)
```

### Why Be Humble?

from [workbook January–February 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-January-2-8-2023/Why-Be-Humble/)

- Josiah was eager to please Jehovah (2Ki 22:1-5)
- He humbly admitted the errors of the people (2Ki 22:13; w00 9/15 29-30)
- Because Josiah was humble, Jehovah blessed him (2Ki 22:18-20; w00 9/15 30 ¶2)

We gain Jehovah’s favor when we humbly turn to him for guidance and when we admit our mistakes and correct our path.​—Jas 4:6.

## 2 Kings 23

```
Josiah’s reforms (1-20)
Passover celebrated (21-23)
Josiah’s further reforms (24-27)
Josiah’s death (28-30)
Jehoahaz, king of Judah (31-33)
Jehoiakim, king of Judah (34-37)
```

#### 2Ki 23:24, 25​—What encouragement does Josiah’s example provide for those who have endured a difficult childhood? (w01 4/15 26 ¶3-4)

Despite the negative circumstances of his early childhood, Josiah proceeded to do what was good in Jehovah’s eyes. So successful was his reign that the Bible states: “Like him there did not prove to be a king prior to him who returned to Jehovah with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his vital force, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him has there risen up one like him.”​—2 Kings 23:19-25.

What an encouraging example Josiah proves to be for those who may have had to endure a terrible childhood! What can we learn from his example? What helped Josiah to choose the right course and stay on it?

## 2 Kings 24

```
Jehoiakim’s rebellion and death (1-7)
Jehoiachin, king of Judah (8, 9)
First deportation to Babylon (10-17)
Zedekiah, king of Judah; his rebellion (18-20)
```

#### 2Ki 24:3, 4​—What do these verses teach us about Jehovah? (w05 8/1 12 ¶1)

On account of Manasseh’s bloodguilt, Jehovah “did not consent to grant forgiveness” to Judah. God respects the blood of the innocent. We can be confident that Jehovah will avenge innocent blood by destroying those responsible for shedding it.​—Psalm 37:9-11; 145:20.

## 2 Kings 25

```
Nebuchadnezzar’s siege of Jerusalem (1-7)
Jerusalem and its temple destroyed; second deportation (8-21)
Gedaliah made governor (22-24)
Gedaliah murdered; people flee to Egypt (25, 26)
Jehoiachin released in Babylon (27-30)
```

### Maintain Your Sense of Urgency

from [workbook January–February 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-January-9-15-2023/Maintain-Your-Sense-of-Urgency/)

- For years, Jehovah warned the people of Judah that he would reject them if they continued to act wickedly (2Ki 24:2, 3; w01 2/15 12 ¶2)
- Jehovah used the Babylonians to destroy Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. (2Ki 25:8-10; w07 3/15 11 ¶10)
- Jehovah spared the lives of those who responded to his warnings (2Ki 25:11)

For many decades, Jehovah has been warning earth’s inhabitants that he will execute judgment on “the ungodly people.”​—2Pe 3:7.
