#### 2Ki 2:11​—Where did Elijah go when he “ascended to the heavens in the windstorm”? (w05 8/1 9 ¶1)

These were neither the distant parts of the physical universe nor the spiritual place where God and his angelic sons dwell. (Deuteronomy 4:19; Psalm 11:4; Matthew 6:9; 18:10) “The heavens” to which Elijah ascended were the atmospheric heavens. (Psalm 78:26; Matthew 6:26) Racing through earth’s atmosphere, the fiery chariot evidently transferred Elijah to another part of the earth, where he continued living for a time. Years later, in fact, Elijah wrote a letter to Jehoram, the king of Judah.​—2 Chronicles 21:1, 12-15.

### A Fine Example of Training

from [workbook September–October 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-24-30-2022/A-Fine-Example-of-Training/)

- Elisha watched as Elijah performed a miracle (2Ki 2:8; w15 4/15 13 ¶15; see cover picture)
- Elisha humbly used the fine training he received (2Ki 2:13, 14; w15 4/15 13 ¶16)

In the congregation, Jehovah entrusts the elders with the responsibility of training others. (2Ti 2:2) If the elders offer you training, be willing, reliable, and humble.
