## 2 Kings 13

```
Jehoahaz, king of Israel (1-9)
Jehoash, king of Israel (10-13)
Elisha tests Jehoash’s zeal (14-19)
Elisha’s death; his bones resurrect a man (20, 21)
Elisha’s final prophecy fulfilled (22-25)
```

#### 2Ki 13:20, 21​—Does this miracle support the veneration of religious relics? (w05 8/1 11 ¶3)

No, it does not. The Bible does not show that the bones of Elisha were ever venerated. It was God’s power that made this miracle possible, as was the case with all the miracles Elisha performed when he was still alive.

### Wholehearted Effort Results in Abundant Blessings

from [workbook November–December 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-5-11-2022/Wholehearted-Effort-Results-in-Abundant-Blessings/)

- Elisha instructed King Jehoash to take a certain action to illustrate how Israel would defeat Syria (2Ki 13:15-18)
- Because Jehoash was not wholehearted, his success was limited (2Ki 13:19; w10 4/15 26 ¶11)
- Jehovah abundantly blesses his servants who seek him earnestly (Heb 11:6; w13 11/1 11 ¶5-6)

**ASK YOURSELF,** ‘How do I demonstrate wholehearted effort in such aspects of my worship as Bible reading, meeting attendance, and the field ministry?’
