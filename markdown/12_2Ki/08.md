#### 2Ki 8:19​—How did Jehovah give “a lamp” to David and his sons? (it-2 195 ¶7)

Jehovah God established King David on the throne of Israel, and David proved to be a wise guide and leader of the nation, under God’s direction. He was therefore called “the lamp of Israel.” (2Sa 21:17) In his kingdom covenant with David, Jehovah promised: “Your very throne will become one firmly established to time indefinite.” (2Sa 7:11-16) Accordingly, the dynasty, or family line, of rulers from David through his son Solomon was as a “lamp” to Israel.​—1Ki 11:36; 15:4; 2Ki 8:19; 2Ch 21:7.
