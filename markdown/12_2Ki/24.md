#### 2Ki 24:3, 4​—What do these verses teach us about Jehovah? (w05 8/1 12 ¶1)

On account of Manasseh’s bloodguilt, Jehovah “did not consent to grant forgiveness” to Judah. God respects the blood of the innocent. We can be confident that Jehovah will avenge innocent blood by destroying those responsible for shedding it.​—Psalm 37:9-11; 145:20.
