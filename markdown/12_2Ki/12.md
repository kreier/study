## 2 Kings 12

```
Jehoash, king of Judah (1-3)
Jehoash repairs the temple (4-16)
Syrian invasion (17, 18)
Jehoash killed (19-21)
```

#### 2Ki 12:1​—Why is it significant that Jehovah preserved Jehoash alive? (it-1 1265-1266)

Thereafter, as long as High Priest Jehoiada lived and acted as father and adviser to Jehoash, the young monarch prospered. Married by the time he was 21, he had two wives, one of whom  was named Jehoaddan, and by these Jehoash became father to sons and daughters. In this way the line of David leading to the Messiah, which had come so near to being completely severed, was once again made strong.​—2Ki 12:1-3; 2Ch 24:1-3; 25:1.
