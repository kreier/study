## 2 Kings 5

```
Naaman healed of leprosy by Elisha (1-19)
Greedy Gehazi struck with leprosy (20-27)
```

#### 2Ki 5:15, 16​—Why did Elisha not accept Naaman’s gift, and what lesson can we learn? (w05 8/1 9 ¶2)

Elisha refused the gift because he recognized that the miracle of healing Naaman was performed by Jehovah’s power, not his own. It would have been unthinkable on his part to profit from his God-appointed office. True worshippers today do not reach out for personal gain from Jehovah’s service. They take to heart Jesus’ admonition: “You received free, give free.”​—Matthew 10:8.
