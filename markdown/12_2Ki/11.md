### An Ambitious, Wicked Woman Does Not Go Unpunished

- Athaliah murdered the royal offspring so that she could rule over Judah (2Ki 11:1; it-1 209; see the chart “‘The Whole House of Ahab Will Perish’​—2Ki 9:8”)
- Jehosheba hid Jehoash, the heir to the throne (2Ki 11:2, 3)
- High Priest Jehoiada installed Jehoash as king and executed wicked Athaliah, who was perhaps the last of Ahab’s house (2Ki 11:12-16; it-1 209)

**FOR MEDITATION:** How does this account illustrate the truthfulness of Proverbs 11:21 and Ecclesiastes 8:12, 13?
