### Jehovah Made the Unexpected Happen

from [workbook November–December 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-14-20-2022/Jehovah-Made-the-Unexpected-Happen/)

- During a severe famine, Jehovah said that food supplies would be abundant the next day (2Ki 7:1; it-1 716-717)
- An Israelite official scoffed at Jehovah’s promise (2Ki 7:2)
- Jehovah made the unexpected happen (2Ki 7:6, 7, 16-18)

Jehovah says that the destruction of this system will be sudden and unexpected. (1Th 5:2, 3) Why is it important for us to have faith in Jehovah’s word?
