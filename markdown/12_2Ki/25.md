- For years, Jehovah warned the people of Judah that he would reject them if they continued to act wickedly (2Ki 24:2, 3; w01 2/15 12 ¶2)
- Jehovah used the Babylonians to destroy Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. (2Ki 25:8-10; w07 3/15 11 ¶10)
- Jehovah spared the lives of those who responded to his warnings (2Ki 25:11)

For many decades, Jehovah has been warning earth’s inhabitants that he will execute judgment on “the ungodly people.”​—2Pe 3:7.
