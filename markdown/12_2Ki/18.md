### How Our Opposers Try to Weaken Us

from [workbook November–December 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-19-25-2022/How-Our-Opposers-Try-to-Weaken-Us/)

- Our opposers try to discourage us by lying about those taking the lead (2Ki 18:19-21; w05 8/1 11 ¶5)
- They try to mislead us by misrepresenting Jehovah or the organization (2Ki 18:22, 25; w10 7/15 13 ¶3)
- They try to tempt us by making false promises (2Ki 18:31, 32; w13 11/15 19 ¶14; yb74 177 ¶1)

**ASK YOURSELF,** ‘What steps can I take now to strengthen myself for persecution?’
