## Psalms 119

```
Appreciation for God’s precious word
‘How can youths keep a clean path?’ (9)
“I am fond of your reminders” (24)
“Your word is my hope” (74, 81, 114)
“How I do love your law!” (97)
“More insight than all my teachers” (99)
“Your word is a lamp to my foot” (105)
‘The essence of your word is truth’ (160)
Peace for those who love God’s law (165)
```
