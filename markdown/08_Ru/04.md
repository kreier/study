#### Ru 4:6​—In what way could a repurchaser “ruin” his own inheritance by doing the repurchasing? (w05 3/1 29 ¶3)

First of all, if the one falling into poverty had sold his land inheritance, a repurchaser would have to put out money to buy the land at a price determined by the number of years remaining till the next Jubilee. (Leviticus 25:25-27) Doing so would reduce the value of his own estate. Moreover, should a son be born to Ruth, that son, rather than any of the repurchaser’s current near relatives, would inherit the purchased field.
