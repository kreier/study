## Ruth 1

```
Elimelech’s family moves to Moab (1, 2)
Naomi, Orpah, and Ruth widowed (3-6)
Ruth loyal to Naomi and her God (7-17)
Naomi returns to Bethlehem with Ruth (18-22)
```

#### Ru 1:20, 21​—Why did Naomi say that Jehovah had made her life bitter? (w05 3/1 27 ¶1)

Naomi did not charge God with any wrongdoing. In view of all that had happened to her, however, she thought that Jehovah was against her. She felt bitter and disillusioned. Moreover, in those days the fruitage of the belly was considered a divine blessing and barrenness, a curse. Lacking grandchildren and with two sons dead, Naomi might have felt justified in thinking that Jehovah had humiliated her.

from [workbook January–February 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-January-24-30-2022/Pursue-Loyal-Love/)

- Naomi urged Orpah and Ruth to return to Moab (Ru 1:8-13; w16.02 14 ¶5)
- Ruth refused to abandon Naomi and Jehovah (Ru 1:16, 17; w16.02 14 ¶6)

Loyal love is motivated by commitment, integrity, loyalty, and deep attachment. Jehovah demonstrates loyal love to his faithful servants. (Ps 63:3) We too should show loyal love to others.​—Pr 21:21.
