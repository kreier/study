#### Ge 25:31-34 ​— *Why does this account not prove that the line leading to the Messiah was tied to the right of firstborn?* (Heb 12:16; w17.12 15 ¶5-7)

The apostle Paul was not here discussing the ancestry of the Messiah. He had just urged Christians to 'make straight paths for their feet.'

Esau lived in patriarchal times, and he may even occasionally have had the privilege of offering sacrifices. (Gen. 8:20, 21; 12:7, 8; Job 1:4, 5) But with his fleshly bent of mind, Esau gave away all such privileges for a bowl of stew. He may have wanted to avoid the suffering foretold to come on Abraham’s offspring. (Gen. 15:13) Esau also showed himself inclined toward the profane, lacking appreciation for sacred things, by marrying two pagan women, to his parents’ grief. (Gen. 26:34, 35) What a contrast he was to Jacob, who made sure to marry a worshipper of the true God!​—Gen. 28:6, 7; 29:10-12, 18. 

### Esau Sells His Birthright

**25:27-34** from workbook March 2020

Esau did "not appreciate sacred things." (Heb 12:16) As a result, he sold his birthright. He also married two pagan women.​—Ge 26:34, 35.

**ASK YOURSELF:** 'How can I show greater appreciation for the following sacred things?'
- My relationship with Jehovah
- Holy spirit
- Bearing the holy name, Jehovah
- The field ministry
- Christian meetings
- Marriage
