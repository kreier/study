## Genesis 6

```
Sons of God take wives on earth (1-3)
Nephilim born (4)
Mankind’s badness saddens Jehovah (5-8)
Noah commissioned to build an ark (9-16)
God proclaims the coming of the Flood (17-22)
```

### "He Did Just So"

6:9, 13-16, 22 from workbook 2020

Imagine how much effort was required for Noah and his family to build the ark without modern tools and construction methods.

- The structure was enormous​—about 437 feet (133 m) long, 73 feet (22 m) wide, and 44 feet (13 m) tall
- Trees had to be cut, hewn, and lifted into place
- Both the inside and outside of the massive structure had to be covered with tar
- A one year’s supply of food had to be stockpiled for Noah’s family and the animals
- The project likely took 40 to 50 years to complete
