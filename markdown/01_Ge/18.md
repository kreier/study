## Genesis 18

```
Three angels visit Abraham (1-8)
A son promised to Sarah; she laughs (9-15)
Abraham pleads for Sodom (16-33)
```

#### Ge 18:1, 22 ​— *How was it that "Jehovah appeared to" Abraham and "remained with" him?* (w88 5/15 23 ¶4-5)

Now it is possible to understand why Abraham addressed the materialized angelic spokesman of God as if he were talking to Jehovah God himself. Since this angel spoke precisely what God wanted to have said to Abraham and was there personally representing Him, the Biblical record could say that "Jehovah appeared to him."​—Genesis 18:1.

Remember that an angelic spokesman for God could transmit His messages just as precisely as a telephone or a radio can transmit our words to another person. Hence, it can be understood how Abraham, Moses, Manoah, and others could speak with a materialized angel as if they were talking to God. While such individuals were able to see these angels and the glory of Jehovah reflected by them, they were not able to see God. Therefore, this in no way contradicts the apostle John’s statement: "No man has seen God at any time." (John 1:18) What these men saw were angelic representatives and not God himself.

### "The Judge of All the Earth" Destroys Sodom and Gomorrah

**18:23-25, 32; 19:24, 25** from the workbook February 2020

What do we learn from Jehovah’s actions regarding Sodom and Gomorrah?

- Jehovah will not indefinitely tolerate wickedness
- Those who survive the coming judgment will be those who pay attention to God’s will and do it.​—Lu 17:28-30

**ASK YOURSELF:** 'Does the brazen conduct of this wicked world distress me?' (2Pe 2:7) 'Does my daily life show that doing Jehovah’s will is most important to me?'
