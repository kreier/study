### Jacob Marries

**29:18-28** from workbook March 2020

Jacob did not know in advance the trials that he would face as a result of marriage. Rachel and Leah became rivals. (Ge 29:32; 30:1, 8) Despite trials, however, Jacob saw that Jehovah was with him. (Ge 30:29, 30, 43) Ultimately, his offspring became the nation of Israel.​—Ru 4:11.

In our day, those who choose to marry will face challenges. (1Co 7:28) Nevertheless, they can have a successful marriage and a measure of happiness by relying on Jehovah and applying Bible principles.​—Pr 3:5, 6; Eph 5:33.
