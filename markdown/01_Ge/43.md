#### Ge 43:32​—*Why was eating a meal with the Hebrews detestable to the Egyptians?* (w04 1/15 29 ¶1)

 This may largely have been because of religious prejudice or racial pride. The Egyptians also detested shepherds. (Genesis 46:34) Why? Sheepherders may simply have been near the bottom in the Egyptian caste system. Or it could be that since the land available for cultivation was limited, the Egyptians despised those seeking pasture for flocks.
