Ge 4:23, 24 ​— *Why did Lamech compose this poem?* (it-2 192 ¶5)

The poem that Lamech composed for his wives (Ge 4:23, 24) reflects the violent spirit of that day. Lamech's poem ran: "Hear my voice, you wives of Lamech; give ear to my saying: A man I have killed for wounding me, yes, a young man for giving me a blow. If seven times Cain is to be avenged, then Lamech seventy times and seven." Evidently Lamech was presenting a case of self-defense, pleading that his act was not one of deliberate murder, like that of Cain. Lamech claimed that, in defending himself, he had killed the man who struck and wounded him. Therefore, his poem stood as a plea for immunity against anyone desiring to get revenge against him for killing his attacker.

Ge 4:26 ​— *In what way apparently did people in Enosh’s day begin "calling on the name of Jehovah"?* (it-1 338 ¶2)
