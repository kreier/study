Ge 1:1 ​— **What does the Bible say about the age of the earth?** (w15 6/1 5)

When God said on Day One, "Let light come to be," diffused light evidently penetrated the cloud layers even though the sources of that light could not yet be discerned from the earth’s surface. It seems that this was a gradual process, as is indicated by translator J. W. Watts: "And gradually light came into existence." (Ge 1:3, A Distinctive Translation of Genesis) God brought about a division between the light and the darkness, calling the light Day and the darkness Night. This indicates that the earth was rotating on its axis as it revolved around the sun, so that its hemispheres, eastern and western, could enjoy periods of light and darkness.​—Ge 1:3, 4.

Ge 1:26 ​— **Was Jesus a co-Creator?** (it-2 52)

Ge 4:23, 24 ​— **Why did Lamech compose this poem?** (it-2 192 ¶5)

The poem that Lamech composed for his wives (Ge 4:23, 24) reflects the violent spirit of that day. Lamech's poem ran: "Hear my voice, you wives of Lamech; give ear to my saying: A man I have killed for wounding me, yes, a young man for giving me a blow. If seven times Cain is to be avenged, then Lamech seventy times and seven." Evidently Lamech was presenting a case of self-defense, pleading that his act was not one of deliberate murder, like that of Cain. Lamech claimed that, in defending himself, he had killed the man who struck and wounded him. Therefore, his poem stood as a plea for immunity against anyone desiring to get revenge against him for killing his attacker.
