# Genesis

Written by Moses in the wildernis. The writing was completed 1513 B.C.E. The time covered is from "In the beginning" to 1657 B.C.E.

## Genesis 1

```
Creation of heavens and earth (1, 2)
Six days of preparing the earth (3-31)
  Day 1: light; day and night (3-5)
  Day 2: expanse (6-8)
  Day 3: dry land and vegetation (9-13)
  Day 4: heavenly luminaries (14-19)
  Day 5: fish and birds (20-23)
  Day 6: land animals and humans (24-31)
```

#### Ge 1:1 ​— *What does the Bible say about the age of the earth?* (w15 6/1 5)

When God said on Day One, "Let light come to be," diffused light evidently penetrated the cloud layers even though the sources of that light could not yet be discerned from the earth’s surface. It seems that this was a gradual process, as is indicated by translator J. W. Watts: "And gradually light came into existence." (Ge 1:3, A Distinctive Translation of Genesis) God brought about a division between the light and the darkness, calling the light Day and the darkness Night. This indicates that the earth was rotating on its axis as it revolved around the sun, so that its hemispheres, eastern and western, could enjoy periods of light and darkness.​—Ge 1:3, 4.

#### Ge 1:26 ​— *Was Jesus a co-Creator?* (it-2 52)

## Genesis 2

```
God rests on the seventh day (1-3)
Jehovah God, Maker of heaven and earth (4)
Man and woman in the garden of Eden (5-25)
  Man formed out of dust (7)
  Forbidden tree of knowledge (15-17)
  Creation of woman (18-25)
```

## Genesis 3

```
Origin of man’s sin (1-13)
  The first lie (4, 5)
Jehovah’s judgment on the rebels (14-24)
  Woman’s offspring foretold (15)
  Expulsion from Eden (23, 24)
```

### The Devastating Consequences of the First Lie

**3:1-6, 15-19** from workbook January 2020

Satan has been misleading humans ever since he lied to Eve. (Re 12:9) How do the following lies that are promoted by Satan hinder people from drawing close to Jehovah?

- There is no all-powerful divine being
- God is a mysterious Trinity
- God does not have a name
- God torments people forever in a burning hell
- Everything that happens is God’s will
- God does not care about humans

## Genesis 4

```
Cain and Abel (1-16)
Cain’s descendants (17-24)
Seth and his son Enosh (25, 26)
```

#### Ge 4:23, 24 ​— *Why did Lamech compose this poem?* (it-2 192 ¶5)

The poem that Lamech composed for his wives (Ge 4:23, 24) reflects the violent spirit of that day. Lamech's poem ran: "Hear my voice, you wives of Lamech; give ear to my saying: A man I have killed for wounding me, yes, a young man for giving me a blow. If seven times Cain is to be avenged, then Lamech seventy times and seven." Evidently Lamech was presenting a case of self-defense, pleading that his act was not one of deliberate murder, like that of Cain. Lamech claimed that, in defending himself, he had killed the man who struck and wounded him. Therefore, his poem stood as a plea for immunity against anyone desiring to get revenge against him for killing his attacker.

#### Ge 4:26 ​— *In what way apparently did people in Enosh’s day begin "calling on the name of Jehovah"?* (it-1 338 ¶2)

## Genesis 5

```
From Adam to Noah (1-32)
  Adam fathered sons and daughters (4)
  Enoch walked with God (21-24)
```

## Genesis 6

```

Nephilim born (4)
Mankind’s badness saddens Jehovah (5-8)
Noah commissioned to build an ark (9-16)
God proclaims the coming of the Flood (17-22)
```

### "He Did Just So"

**6:9, 13-16, 22** from workbook 2020

Imagine how much effort was required for Noah and his family to build the ark without modern tools and construction methods.

- The structure was enormous​—about 437 feet (133 m) long, 73 feet (22 m) wide, and 44 feet (13 m) tall
- Trees had to be cut, hewn, and lifted into place
- Both the inside and outside of the massive structure had to be covered with tar
- A one year’s supply of food had to be stockpiled for Noah’s family and the animals
- The project likely took 40 to 50 years to complete

## Genesis 7

```
Entering the ark (1-10)
The global Flood (11-24)
```

#### Ge 7:2 ​— *What evidently was the basis for the distinction between clean and unclean animals?* (w04 1/1 29 ¶7)

The basis of distinction evidently pertained to the use of sacrifices in worship and not to what could and could not be eaten. Animal flesh was not a part of man’s diet prior to the Flood. The designations "clean" and "unclean" for food came into existence only with the Mosaic Law, and they ended when it was abolished. (Acts 10:9-16; Ephesians 2:15) Apparently, Noah knew what was suitable for sacrifice in the worship of Jehovah. As soon as he left the ark, he "began to build an altar to Jehovah and to take some of all the clean beasts and of all the clean flying creatures and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar."​—Genesis 8:20.

#### Ge 7:11​ — *Where apparently did the water that caused the global Flood come from?* (w04 1/1 30 ¶1)

During the second creative period, or "day", when the earth’s atmospheric "expanse" was formed, there were waters "beneath the expanse" and waters "above the expanse." (Genesis 1:6, 7) The waters "beneath" were those already on earth. The waters "above" were huge quantities of moisture suspended high above the earth, forming a "vast watery deep." These waters fell upon the earth in Noah’s day.

## Genesis 8

```
The floodwaters subside (1-14)
  Dove sent out (8-12)
Leaving the ark (15-19)
God’s promise for the earth (20-22)
```

## Genesis 9

```
Instructions for all mankind (1-7)
  Law about blood (4-6)
Rainbow covenant (8-17)
Prophecies about Noah’s descendants (18-29)
```

#### Ge 9:20-22, 24, 25 ​— *Why might Noah have cursed Canaan instead of Ham?* (it-1 1023 ¶4)

It is possible that Canaan himself had been involved directly in the incident and that his father Ham had failed to correct him. Or Noah, speaking prophetically by inspiration, foresaw that the bad tendency in Ham, perhaps already manifest in his son Canaan, would be inherited by Canaan’s offspring. The curse was partly fulfilled when the Semitic Israelites subjugated the Canaanites. Those who were not destroyed (for example, the Gibeonites [Jos 9]) were made slaves to Israel. Centuries later, the curse was further fulfilled when descendants of Ham’s son Canaan came under the domination of the Japhetic world powers of Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome.

#### Ge 10:9, 10 ​— *How was Nimrod "a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah"?* (it-2 503)

The beginning of Nimrod’s kingdom included the cities of Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, all in the land of Shinar. (Ge 10:10) Therefore it was likely under his direction that the building of Babel and its tower began. This conclusion is also in agreement with the traditional Jewish view. Wrote Josephus: "[Nimrod] little by little transformed the state of affairs into a tyranny, holding that the only way to detach men from the fear of God was by making them continuously dependent upon his own power. He threatened to have his revenge on God if He wished to inundate the earth again; for he would build a tower higher than the water could reach and avenge the destruction of their forefathers. The people were eager to follow this advice of [Nimrod], deeming it slavery to submit to God; so they set out to build the tower . . . and it rose with a speed beyond all expectation." ​— Jewish Antiquities, I, 114, 115 (iv, 2, 3).

## Genesis 10

```
List of the nations (1-32)
  Descendants of Japheth (2-5)
  Descendants of Ham (6-20)
    Nimrod opposes Jehovah (8-12)
  Descendants of Shem (21-31)
```

## Genesis 11

```
Tower of Babel (1-4)
Jehovah confuses the language (5-9)
From Shem to Abram (10-32)
  Terah’s family (27)
  Abram leaves Ur (31)
```

### "All the Earth Continued to Be of One Language"

**11:1-4, 6-9** from workbook January 2020

At Babel, Jehovah scattered disobedient humans by confusing their language. Today he is gathering a great crowd out of all nations and tongues and giving them "a pure language" so that they "may call on the name of Jehovah, to serve him shoulder to shoulder." (Zep 3:9; Re 7:9) This "pure language" is the truth about Jehovah and his purposes as found in the Scriptures.

Learning a new language takes more than just memorizing new words. It requires learning a new way of thinking, new thought patterns. Similarly, as we learn the pure language of truth, our minds are transformed. (Ro 12:2) This is a continuing process that results in unity among God’s people.​—1Co 1:10.


## Genesis 12

```
Abram leaves Haran for Canaan (1-9)
  God’s promise to Abram (7)
Abram and Sarai in Egypt (10-20)
```

### A Covenant That Affects You

**12:1-3; 13:14-17** from the workbook February 2020

- Jehovah made a covenant with Abraham, which formed the legal foundation of the Kingdom of the heavens
- The covenant apparently went into effect in 1943 B.C.E. when Abraham crossed the Euphrates River on his way to Canaan
- The covenant remains in effect until the Messianic Kingdom destroys God’s enemies and brings blessings to all the families of the earth

Jehovah blessed Abraham for his great faith. If we demonstrate faith in Jehovah’s promises, what blessings await us as a result of the Abrahamic covenant?

## Genesis 13

```
Abram returns to Canaan (1-4)
Abram and Lot separate (5-13)
God’s promise to Abram repeated (14-18)
```

#### Ge 13:8, 9 ​— *How can we imitate Abraham when resolving disputes?* (w16.05 5 ¶12)

A Scriptural account in which God’s servants peacefully resolved a potentially divisive issue is the one mentioned earlier involving Abraham and his nephew Lot. Both men possessed livestock, and their shepherds apparently quarreled about grazing land. Eager to eliminate tensions, Abraham offered Lot first choice of the areas where their respective households would settle. (Gen. 13:1, 2, 5-9) What a good example! Abraham sought peace, not his own interests. Did he lose out because of his generosity? Not at all. Immediately after this incident with Lot, Jehovah promised Abraham great blessings. (Gen. 13:14-17) God will never allow his servants to suffer lasting loss for acting in harmony with divine principles and settling differences in a spirit of love

## Genesis 14

```
Abram rescues Lot (1-16)
Melchizedek blesses Abram (17-24)
```

#### Ge 14:18-20 ​— *How did Levi pay "tithes through Abraham"?* (Heb 7:4-10; it-2 683 ¶1)

Melchizedek king of Salem was a priest (ko·henʹ) extraordinary. The Bible gives no record of his ancestry, his birth, or his death. His priesthood was not by inheritance, and he had no predecessors or successors in office. Melchizedek held both the office of king and of priest. His priesthood was greater than the Levitical priesthood, for Levi, in effect, paid tithes to Melchizedek, since he was still in the loins of Abraham when Abraham offered tithes to Melchizedek and was blessed by him. (Ge 14:18-20; Heb 7:4-10) In these things Melchizedek foreshadowed Jesus Christ, the "priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek."​—Heb 7:17.

## Genesis 15

```
God’s covenant with Abram (1-21)
  The 400 years of affliction foretold (13)
  God’s promise to Abram repeated (18-21)
```

#### Ge 15:13, 14 ​— *When did the 400 years of affliction begin and end?* (it-1 460-461)

Jehovah told Abram (Abraham): "You may know for sure that your seed will become an alien resident in a land not theirs, and they will have to serve them, and these will certainly afflict them for four hundred years." (Ge 15:13; see also Ac 7:6, 7.) This was stated prior to the birth of the promised heir or "seed," Isaac. In 1932 B.C.E. Ishmael was born to Abram by the Egyptian servant girl Hagar, and in 1918 B.C.E. Isaac was born. (Ge 16:16; 21:5) Counting back 400 years from the Exodus, which marked the end of the ‘afflicting’ (Ge 15:14), would bring us to 1913 B.C.E., and at that time Isaac was about five years old. It appears that Isaac was weaned then and, already "an alien resident" in a land not his, he now experienced the start of the foretold affliction in the form of Ishmael’s "poking fun," Ishmael being about 19. (Ge 21:8, 9) Although in modern times Ishmael’s mocking of Abraham’s heir might be viewed as inconsequential, such was not the case in patriarchal times. This is evidenced by Sarah’s reaction and God’s approval of her insistence that Hagar and her son Ishmael be sent away. (Ge 21:10-13) The very fact that this incident was recorded in detail in the divine record also points to its marking the commencement of the prophesied 400-year period of affliction that would not end until the Exodus.​—Ga 4:29.

#### Ge 15:16 ​— *How did Abraham’s descendants return to Canaan "in the fourth generation"?* (it-1 778 ¶4)

**"In the fourth generation."** We must remember that Jehovah told Abraham that in the fourth generation his descendants would return to Canaan. (Ge 15:16) In the entire 430 years from the time when the Abrahamic covenant took effect to the Exodus there were more than four generations, even considering the long life spans that they enjoyed during that time, according to the record. But it was only 215 years that the Israelites were *actually in Egypt*. The 'four generations' following their entering Egypt can be calculated in this way, using as an example just one tribe of Israel, the tribe of Levi: (1) Levi, (2) Kohath, (3) Amram, and (4) Moses.​—Ex 6:16, 18, 20.

## Genesis 16

```
Hagar and Ishmael (1-16)
```

## Genesis 17

```
Abraham to become a father of many nations (1-8)
  Abram renamed Abraham (5)
Covenant of circumcision (9-14)
Sarai renamed Sarah (15-17)
Son Isaac promised (18-27)
```

### Jehovah Renamed Abram and Sarai​—Why?

**17:1, 3-5, 15, 16** from the workbook February 2020

Jehovah viewed Abram as faultless before Him. When he expanded on his promise to Abram, he gave Abram and Sarai names with prophetic meaning.

True to their names, Abraham became the father of many nations and Sarah became an ancestress of kings.

- **Abraham** - Father of a Multitude
- **Sarah** - Princess

We cannot choose the name given to us at birth. But like Abraham and Sarah, we can establish our own reputation. Ask yourself:
- 'How can I be viewed by Jehovah as faultless?'
- 'What kind of name am I making with Jehovah?'

## Genesis 18

```
Three angels visit Abraham (1-8)
A son promised to Sarah; she laughs (9-15)
Abraham pleads for Sodom (16-33)
```

#### Ge 18:1, 22 ​— *How was it that "Jehovah appeared to" Abraham and "remained with" him?* (w88 5/15 23 ¶4-5)

Now it is possible to understand why Abraham addressed the materialized angelic spokesman of God as if he were talking to Jehovah God himself. Since this angel spoke precisely what God wanted to have said to Abraham and was there personally representing Him, the Biblical record could say that "Jehovah appeared to him."​—Genesis 18:1.

Remember that an angelic spokesman for God could transmit His messages just as precisely as a telephone or a radio can transmit our words to another person. Hence, it can be understood how Abraham, Moses, Manoah, and others could speak with a materialized angel as if they were talking to God. While such individuals were able to see these angels and the glory of Jehovah reflected by them, they were not able to see God. Therefore, this in no way contradicts the apostle John’s statement: "No man has seen God at any time." (John 1:18) What these men saw were angelic representatives and not God himself.

### "The Judge of All the Earth" Destroys Sodom and Gomorrah

**18:23-25, 32; 19:24, 25** from the workbook February 2020

What do we learn from Jehovah’s actions regarding Sodom and Gomorrah?

- Jehovah will not indefinitely tolerate wickedness
- Those who survive the coming judgment will be those who pay attention to God’s will and do it.​—Lu 17:28-30

**ASK YOURSELF:** 'Does the brazen conduct of this wicked world distress me?' (2Pe 2:7) 'Does my daily life show that doing Jehovah’s will is most important to me?'

## Genesis 19

```
Lot visited by angels (1-11)
Lot and his family urged to leave (12-22)
Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed (23-29)
  Lot’s wife becomes a pillar of salt (26)
Lot and his daughters (30-38)
  Origin of Moab and Ammon (37, 38)
```

#### Ge 19:26 ​— *Why did Lot’s wife become "a pillar of salt"?* (w19.06 20 ¶3)

Lot made a bad decision when he chose to live among the grossly immoral people of Sodom. (**Read** 2 Peter 2:7, 8.) The region was prosperous, but Lot paid a high price for moving to Sodom. (Gen. 13:8-13; 14:12) His wife apparently became so attached to the city or to some of the people living there that she disobeyed Jehovah. She lost her life when God rained fire and sulfur on the region. And think of Lot’s two daughters. They were engaged to men who died in Sodom. Lot lost his home, his possessions and, most painful of all, his wife. (Gen. 19:12-14, 17, 26) During this stressful period, did Jehovah lose patience with Lot? No.

## Genesis 20

```
Sarah rescued from Abimelech (1-18)
```

#### Ge 20:12 ​— *How was Sarah Abraham’s sister?* (wp17.3 12, ftn.)

Sarah was the half sister of Abraham. Terah was father to both of them, but they had different mothers. (Genesis 20:12) While such a marriage is improper today, it is important to keep in mind how different things were back then. Humans were closer to the perfection that Adam and Eve had enjoyed but lost. For such robust people, marriage between close relatives evidently did not present genetic dangers to offspring. Some 400 years later, though, life spans were similar to ours. At that time, the Mosaic Law outlawed all sexual unions between close relatives.​—Leviticus 18:6.

## Genesis 21

```
Birth of Isaac (1-7)
Ishmael mocks Isaac (8, 9)
Hagar and Ishmael sent away (10-21)
Abraham’s covenant with Abimelech (22-34)
```

#### Ge 21:33 ​— *How did Abraham call "on the name of Jehovah"?* (w89 7/1 20 ¶9)

Abram responded with another act of faith. As the account says: "He built an altar there to Jehovah." (Genesis 12:7) Likely, this included offering up an animal sacrifice, for the Hebrew word for "altar" means "place of sacrifice." Later, Abram repeated these acts of faith in other parts of the land. In addition, he ‘called on the name of Jehovah.’ (Genesis 12:8; 13:18; 21:33) The Hebrew phrase "call on the name" also means "declare (preach) the name." Abram’s household as well as the Canaanites must have heard him boldly declare the name of his God, Jehovah. (Genesis 14:22-24) Likewise, all who seek God’s friendship today must call upon his name in faith. This would include sharing in public preaching, "always offer[ing] to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name."​—Hebrews 13:15; Romans 10:10.

### Jehovah Always Does What He Promises

**21:1-3, 5-7, 10-12, 14** from workbook February 2020

Jehovah rewarded Abraham and Sarah for their faith by giving them a son. Later, their obedience under trial showed their remarkable faith in Jehovah’s promises for the future.

How does my obedience during trials show that I trust in Jehovah’s promises for the future? How can I strengthen my faith?
