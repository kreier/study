## Genesis 14

```
Abram rescues Lot (1-16)
Melchizedek blesses Abram (17-24)
```

#### Ge 14:18-20 ​— *How did Levi pay "tithes through Abraham"?* (Heb 7:4-10; it-2 683 ¶1)

Melchizedek king of Salem was a priest (ko·henʹ) extraordinary. The Bible gives no record of his ancestry, his birth, or his death. His priesthood was not by inheritance, and he had no predecessors or successors in office. Melchizedek held both the office of king and of priest. His priesthood was greater than the Levitical priesthood, for Levi, in effect, paid tithes to Melchizedek, since he was still in the loins of Abraham when Abraham offered tithes to Melchizedek and was blessed by him. (Ge 14:18-20; Heb 7:4-10) In these things Melchizedek foreshadowed Jesus Christ, the "priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek."​—Heb 7:17.
