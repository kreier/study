## Genesis 27

```
Jacob gets Isaac’s blessing (1-29)
Esau seeks blessing but is unrepentant (30-40)
Esau’s animosity toward Jacob (41-46)
```

#### Ge 27:46–28:2 ​— *What lessons can married couples learn from this account?* (w06 4/15 6 ¶3-4)

Did Isaac and Rebekah develop good communication skills? After their son Esau married two daughters of Heth, a serious family problem arose. Rebekah "kept saying" to Isaac: “I have come to abhor this life of mine because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob [their younger son] ever takes a wife from the daughters of Heth . . . , of what good is life to me?" (Genesis 26:34; 27:46) Clearly, she communicated her concern in no uncertain terms.

Isaac told Jacob, Esau’s twin brother, not to take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. (Genesis 28:1, 2) Rebekah had made her point. This couple had successfully communicated about a most sensitive family subject, providing a good example for us today.
