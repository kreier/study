## Genesis 36

```
Esau’s descendants (1-30)
Edom’s kings and sheikhs (31-43)
```

#### Ge 36:1​—*Why was Esau given the secondary name Edom?* (it-1 678)

(Eʹdom) [Red], Edomites (Eʹdom·ites).

Edom was the secondary name or byname given to Esau, Jacob’s twin brother. (Ge 36:1) It was applied to him because of his selling his birthright for the red stew. (Ge 25:30-34) Coincidentally, Esau at birth had had a very red color (Ge 25:25), and a similar color prevailed in parts of the land he and his descendants later inhabited.
