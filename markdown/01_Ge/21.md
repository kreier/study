#### Ge 21:33 ​— *How did Abraham call "on the name of Jehovah"?* (w89 7/1 20 ¶9)

Abram responded with another act of faith. As the account says: "He built an altar there to Jehovah." (Genesis 12:7) Likely, this included offering up an animal sacrifice, for the Hebrew word for "altar" means "place of sacrifice." Later, Abram repeated these acts of faith in other parts of the land. In addition, he ‘called on the name of Jehovah.’ (Genesis 12:8; 13:18; 21:33) The Hebrew phrase "call on the name" also means "declare (preach) the name." Abram’s household as well as the Canaanites must have heard him boldly declare the name of his God, Jehovah. (Genesis 14:22-24) Likewise, all who seek God’s friendship today must call upon his name in faith. This would include sharing in public preaching, "always offer[ing] to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name."​—Hebrews 13:15; Romans 10:10.

### Jehovah Always Does What He Promises

**21:1-3, 5-7, 10-12, 14** from workbook February 2020

Jehovah rewarded Abraham and Sarah for their faith by giving them a son. Later, their obedience under trial showed their remarkable faith in Jehovah’s promises for the future.

How does my obedience during trials show that I trust in Jehovah’s promises for the future? How can I strengthen my faith?
