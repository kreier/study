Entering the ark (1-10)
The global Flood (11-24)

Ge 7:2 ​— *What evidently was the basis for the distinction between clean and unclean animals?* (w04 1/1 29 ¶7)

The basis of distinction evidently pertained to the use of sacrifices in worship and not to what could and could not be eaten. Animal flesh was not a part of man’s diet prior to the Flood. The designations "clean" and "unclean" for food came into existence only with the Mosaic Law, and they ended when it was abolished. (Acts 10:9-16; Ephesians 2:15) Apparently, Noah knew what was suitable for sacrifice in the worship of Jehovah. As soon as he left the ark, he "began to build an altar to Jehovah and to take some of all the clean beasts and of all the clean flying creatures and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar."​—Genesis 8:20.

Ge 7:11​ — *Where apparently did the water that caused the global Flood come from?* (w04 1/1 30 ¶1)

During the second creative period, or "day", when the earth’s atmospheric "expanse" was formed, there were waters "beneath the expanse" and waters "above the expanse." (Genesis 1:6, 7) The waters "beneath" were those already on earth. The waters "above" were huge quantities of moisture suspended high above the earth, forming a "vast watery deep." These waters fell upon the earth in Noah’s day.
