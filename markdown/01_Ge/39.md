### Jehovah Never Abandoned Joseph

**39:1, 12-14, 20-23** from workbook May 2020

During Joseph’s many trials, Jehovah made “everything that he did successful” and granted him “favor in the eyes of the chief officer of the prison.” (Ge 39:2, 3, 21-23) What lessons can we learn from this account?

- Our trials do not mean that we have lost Jehovah’s favor.​—Ps 34:19
- We should try to discern how Jehovah is blessing us and be thankful.​—Php 4:6, 7
- We should look to Jehovah to sustain us.​—Ps 55:22
