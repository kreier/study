### "All the Earth Continued to Be of One Language"

11:1-4, 6-9 from workbook January 2020

At Babel, Jehovah scattered disobedient humans by confusing their language. Today he is gathering a great crowd out of all nations and tongues and giving them "a pure language" so that they "may call on the name of Jehovah, to serve him shoulder to shoulder." (Zep 3:9; Re 7:9) This "pure language" is the truth about Jehovah and his purposes as found in the Scriptures.

Learning a new language takes more than just memorizing new words. It requires learning a new way of thinking, new thought patterns. Similarly, as we learn the pure language of truth, our minds are transformed. (Ro 12:2) This is a continuing process that results in unity among God’s people.​—1Co 1:10.
