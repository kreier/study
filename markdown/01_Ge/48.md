### Older Ones Have Much to Share

**48:21, 22; 49:1; 50:24, 25** from workbook 2020

Older ones strengthen our faith in Jehovah and his promises when they tell us firsthand accounts of the “wonderful works” that Jehovah has performed during these last days. (Ps 71:17, 18) If you are blessed with older ones in your congregation, ask them about

- how Jehovah helped them to overcome obstacles in serving him
- the increase that they have seen in the number of Kingdom proclaimers
- their joy at receiving clarifications in our understanding of Bible truth
- the refinements that they have observed in Jehovah’s organization
