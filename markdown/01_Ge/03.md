### The Devastating Consequences of the First Lie

**3:1-6, 15-19** from workbook January 2020

Satan has been misleading humans ever since he lied to Eve. (Re 12:9) How do the following lies that are promoted by Satan hinder people from drawing close to Jehovah?

- There is no all-powerful divine being
- God is a mysterious Trinity
- God does not have a name
- God torments people forever in a burning hell
- Everything that happens is God’s will
- God does not care about humans
