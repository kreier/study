### A Covenant That Affects You

**12:1-3; 13:14-17** from the workbook February 2020

- Jehovah made a covenant with Abraham, which formed the legal foundation of the Kingdom of the heavens
- The covenant apparently went into effect in 1943 B.C.E. when Abraham crossed the Euphrates River on his way to Canaan
- The covenant remains in effect until the Messianic Kingdom destroys God’s enemies and brings blessings to all the families of the earth

Jehovah blessed Abraham for his great faith. If we demonstrate faith in Jehovah’s promises, what blessings await us as a result of the Abrahamic covenant?
