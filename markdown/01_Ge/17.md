## Genesis 17

### Jehovah Renamed Abram and Sarai​—Why?

**17:1, 3-5, 15, 16** from the workbook February 2020

Jehovah viewed Abram as faultless before Him. When he expanded on his promise to Abram, he gave Abram and Sarai names with prophetic meaning.

True to their names, Abraham became the father of many nations and Sarah became an ancestress of kings.

- **Abraham** - Father of a Multitude
- **Sarah** - Princess

We cannot choose the name given to us at birth. But like Abraham and Sarah, we can establish our own reputation. Ask yourself:
- 'How can I be viewed by Jehovah as faultless?'
- 'What kind of name am I making with Jehovah?'
