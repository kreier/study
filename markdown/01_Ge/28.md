## Genesis 28

```
Isaac sends Jacob to Paddan-aram (1-9)
Jacob’s dream at Bethel (10-22)
  God’s promise confirmed to Jacob (13-15)
```

#### Ge 28:12, 13 ​— *What was the significance of Jacob’s dream involving "a stairway"?* (w04 1/15 28 ¶6)

This "ladder," which may have looked like a rising flight of stones, indicated that there is communication between earth and heaven. God’s angels ascending and descending on it showed that angels minister in some important way between Jehovah and humans who have his approval.​—John 1:51.
