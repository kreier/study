#### Ge 44:13​—*What was signified by the ripping of garments?* (it-2 813)

A common sign of grief among the Jews, as well as among other Orientals, particularly upon hearing of the death of a near relative. In many cases such ripping consisted of a rending of the garment in front just sufficient to lay open the breast, thus not necessarily a complete ripping of the garment so as to make it unfit for wearing.

The first instance of this practice recorded in the Bible is that of Reuben, Jacob’s eldest son, who, upon returning and not finding Joseph in the waterpit, ripped his garments apart, saying: “The child is gone! And I​—where am I really to go?” As the firstborn, Reuben was particularly responsible for his younger brother. His father Jacob when told of the supposed death of his son likewise ripped his mantles apart and put on sackcloth in mourning (Ge 37:29, 30, 34), and down in Egypt Joseph’s half brothers showed their grief by ripping their garments apart, when Benjamin was made to appear as a thief.​—Ge 44:13.

### Joseph Forgives His Brothers

**44:1, 2, 33, 34; 45:4, 5** from workbook June 2020

It can be a challenge to forgive, especially when someone has harmed us deliberately. What helped Joseph to forgive his brothers when they wronged him?

- Joseph did not seek revenge but looked for a basis to forgive.​—Ps 86:5; Lu 17:3, 4
- He let go of resentment and reflected the disposition of Jehovah, who forgives generously.​—Mic 7:18, 19
