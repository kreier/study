#### Ge 30:3 ​— *Why did Rachel consider children born to Jacob and Bilhah as her own?* (it-1 50)

Rachel and Leah both considered the children born to Jacob by their handmaids as their own sons, 'born upon their knees.' (Ge 30:3-8, 12, 13, 24) These children inherited along with those born directly of Jacob’s legal wives. They were natural sons of the father, and since the slave girls were property of the wives, Rachel and Leah had property rights in these children.

#### Ge 30:14, 15 ​— *Why may Rachel have relinquished an opportunity to conceive in exchange for some mandrakes?* (w04 1/15 28 ¶7)

In ancient times, the fruit of the mandrake plant was used in medicine as a narcotic and for preventing or relieving spasms. The fruit was also credited with the capacity to excite sexual desire and to increase human fertility or aid in conception. (Song of Solomon 7:13) While the Bible does not reveal Rachel’s motive for the exchange, she may have thought that the mandrakes would help her conceive and end her reproach of being barren. However, it was some years before Jehovah "opened her womb."​—Genesis 30:22-24.
