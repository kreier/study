### The Tragic Results of Bad Association

**34:1, 2, 7, 25** from workbook April 2020

Although we likely see some good qualities in our neighbors, workmates, or schoolmates, does that mean that they are good associates? What can help us determine if someone is good association or not?

- Will their companionship help me improve my relationship with Jehovah?
- What do their conversations reveal about what is important to them?​—Mt 12:34
