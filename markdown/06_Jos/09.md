### Lessons From the Account of the Gibeonites

from [workbook September–October 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-4-10-2021/Lessons-From-the-Account-of-the-Gibeonites/)

- The Gibeonites showed practical wisdom (Jos 9:3-6; it-1 930-931)
- The elders of Israel unwisely did not consult with Jehovah (Jos 9:14, 15; w11 11/15 8 ¶14)
- The Gibeonites humbly served the Israelites (Jos 9:25-27; w04 10/15 18 ¶14)

The Gibeonites performed humble tasks because they wanted to gain Jehovah’s favor. How might we show similar humility today?
