## Joshua 10

```
Israel defends Gibeon (1-7)
Jehovah fights for Israel (8-15)
  Hailstones on fleeing enemies (11)
  The sun stands still (12-14)
The attacking five kings killed (16-28)
Cities in the south captured (29-43)
```

#### Jos 10:13​—Why do we not need to know what was in “the book of Jashar”? (w09 3/15 32 ¶5)

The fact that certain books were mentioned in the Bible and that they were usable sources should not lead us to conclude that they were inspired. However, Jehovah God has preserved all the writings containing “the word of our God,” and these “will last to time indefinite.” (Isa. 40:8) Yes, what Jehovah chose to include in the 66 Bible books that we have is just what we need to “be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.”​—2 Tim. 3:16, 17.

### Jehovah Fights for Israel

from [workbook September–October 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-11-17-2021/Jehovah-Fights-for-Israel/)

- Five kings joined forces against Gibeon and Israel (Jos 10:5; it-1 50)
- Jehovah fought against the coalition (Jos 10:10, 11; it-1 1020)
- Jehovah caused the sun to stand still (Jos 10:12-14; w04 12/1 11 ¶1)

When we face persecution, we trust in Jehovah to help us remain faithful. We know that with his backing, no human government can prevent us from worshipping him.
