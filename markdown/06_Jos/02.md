#### Jos 2:4, 5​—Why did Rahab mislead the king’s men who were searching for the spies? (w04 12/1 9 ¶1)

Rahab protects the spies at the risk of her life because she has come to have faith in Jehovah. Therefore, she is under no obligation to divulge the spies’ whereabouts to men who are seeking to harm God’s people. (Matthew 7:6; 21:23-27; John 7:3-10) In fact, Rahab was “declared righteous by works,” including the act of misdirecting the emissaries of the king.​—James 2:24-26.
