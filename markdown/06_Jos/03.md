### Jehovah Blesses Acts of Faith

from [workbook September–October 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-20-26-2021/Jehovah-Blesses-Acts-of-Faith/)

- Jehovah’s direction may seem unwise from a human standpoint (Jos 3:12, 13; it-2 105; see cover picture)
- Appointed men should take the lead in following instructions (Jos 3:14; w13 9/15 16 ¶17)
-Jehovah blesses decisive action (Jos 3:15-17; w13 9/15 16 ¶18)

We give Jehovah something to bless when we take the initiative to preach, even if we are limited by health or circumstances.
