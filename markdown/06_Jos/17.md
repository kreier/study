#### Jos 17:15, 18​—How do we know that ancient Israel was heavily forested? (w15 7/15 32)

THE Bible states that certain areas of the Promised Land were forested and that trees were “plentiful.” (1 Ki. 10:27; Josh. 17:15, 18) Yet, on seeing the deforested condition of large portions of the land today, skeptics may wonder if that could ever have been the case.

The book *Life in Biblical Israel* explains that “forests in ancient Israel were much more extensive than they are today.” The natural cover of the highlands consisted mainly of Aleppo pine (*Pinus halepensis*), evergreen oak (*Quercus calliprinos*), and terebinth (*Pistacia palaestina*). In the Shephelah, an area that includes the foothills between the central mountain range and the Mediterranean Coast, the sycamore fig (*Ficus sycomorus*) was also abundant.

The book *Plants of the Bible* states that some localities in Israel are now entirely devoid of trees. What contributed to this? Explaining that it was a gradual process, the book says: “Man has persistently interfered with the natural vegetation, mainly in order to expand his farming and pasture area, but also to obtain building materials and fuel for his fire.”
