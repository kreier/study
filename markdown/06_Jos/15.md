### Protect Your Precious Inheritance

from [workbook September–October 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-25-31-2021/Protect-Your-Precious-Inheritance/)

- Caleb protected his inheritance by driving out powerful enemies (Jos 15:14; it-1 1083 ¶3)
- Not all Israelites protected their inheritance from corrupting influences (Jos 16:10; it-1 848)
- Jehovah helped those who truly wanted to protect their inheritance (De 20:1-4; Jos 17:17, 18; it-1 402 ¶3)

Jehovah offers all Christians the precious inheritance of everlasting life. To safeguard our inheritance, we strengthen ourselves against temptation by means of Bible study, Christian meetings, the field ministry, and prayer.
