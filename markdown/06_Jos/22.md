### Lessons From a Misunderstanding

from [workbook November–December 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-8-14-2021/Lessons-From-a-Misunderstanding/)

- The tribes living east of the Jordan built a large, impressive altar (Jos 22:10)
- The other tribes accused them of unfaithfulness (Jos 22:12, 15, 16; w06 4/15 5 ¶3)
- The mild response of those wrongfully accused averted bloodshed (Jos 22:21-30; w08 11/15 18 ¶5)

What does this account teach us about how to react if we are wrongfully accused and about the importance of not drawing conclusions when we do not know the facts?​—Pr 15:1; 18:13.
