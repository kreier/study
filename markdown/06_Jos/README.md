Written by Joshua in Canaan. The writing was completed c. 1450 B.C.E. The time covered is from 1473 to c. 1450 B.C.E.

## Joshua 1

```
Jehovah encourages Joshua (1-9)
  Read the Law in an undertone (8)
Preparations to cross the Jordan (10-18)
```

### How to Make Your Way Successful

from [workbook September–October 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-13-19-2021/How-to-Make-Your-Way-Successful/)

- Study and apply God’s Word (Jos 1:7, 8; w13 1/15 8 ¶7)
- Trust in Jehovah as you carry out his will (Jos 1:9; w13 1/15 11 ¶20)

ASK YOURSELF, ‘In what situations do I need godly courage?’

## Joshua 2

```
Joshua sends two spies to Jericho (1-3)
Rahab hides the spies (4-7)
Promise to Rahab (8-21a)
  Scarlet cord as a sign (18)
The spies return to Joshua (21b-24)
```

#### Jos 2:4, 5​—Why did Rahab mislead the king’s men who were searching for the spies? (w04 12/1 9 ¶1)

Rahab protects the spies at the risk of her life because she has come to have faith in Jehovah. Therefore, she is under no obligation to divulge the spies’ whereabouts to men who are seeking to harm God’s people. (Matthew 7:6; 21:23-27; John 7:3-10) In fact, Rahab was “declared righteous by works,” including the act of misdirecting the emissaries of the king.​—James 2:24-26.

## Joshua 3

```
Israel crosses the Jordan (1-17)
```

### Jehovah Blesses Acts of Faith

from [workbook September–October 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-20-26-2021/Jehovah-Blesses-Acts-of-Faith/)

- Jehovah’s direction may seem unwise from a human standpoint (Jos 3:12, 13; it-2 105; see cover picture)
- Appointed men should take the lead in following instructions (Jos 3:14; w13 9/15 16 ¶17)
-Jehovah blesses decisive action (Jos 3:15-17; w13 9/15 16 ¶18)

We give Jehovah something to bless when we take the initiative to preach, even if we are limited by health or circumstances.

## Joshua 4

```
Stones to serve as a memorial (1-24)
```

## Joshua 5

```
Circumcision at Gilgal (1-9)
Passover celebrated; manna stops (10-12)
Prince of Jehovah’s army (13-15)
```

#### Jos 5:14, 15, ftn.​—Who is thought to be the “chief of Jehovah’s army”? (w04 12/1 9 ¶2)

The prince who comes to strengthen Joshua as the conquest of the Promised Land begins is likely none other than “the Word”​—Jesus Christ in his prehuman existence. (John 1:1; Daniel 10:13) How strengthening it is to have the assurance that the glorified Jesus Christ is with God’s people today as they engage in spiritual warfare!

## Joshua 6

```
Wall of Jericho falls (1-21)
Rahab and her family spared (22-27)
```

#### Jos 6:20​—What evidence is there that the ancient city of Jericho was conquered without a long siege? (w15 11/15 13 ¶2-3)

In ancient times, it was common for attackers to besiege a fortified city. Regardless of how long a successful siege lasted, the victors would plunder the city’s riches, including any remaining provisions. In Jericho’s ruins, however, archaeologists found large supplies of food. In this regard, *Biblical Archaeology Review* states: “The most abundant item found in the destruction, apart from pottery, was grain. . . . This is unique in the annals of Palestinian archaeology. Perhaps a jar or two might be found, but to find such an extensive amount of grain is exceptional.”

According to the Scriptural account, the Israelites had good reason not to plunder Jericho’s grain. Jehovah had commanded them not to do so. (Josh. 6:17, 18) The Israelites attacked in the spring of the year, just after harvesttime when grain supplies were abundant. (Josh. 3:15-17; 5:10) The fact that much grain remained in Jericho indicates that the Israelite siege was of short duration, just as the Bible describes it.

## Joshua 7

```
Israel defeated at Ai (1-5)
Joshua’s prayer (6-9)
Sin cause of Israel’s defeat (10-15)
Achan exposed and stoned (16-26)
```

### Turn Away From Worthless Things

from [workbook September–October 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-27-October-3-2021/Turn-Away-From-Worthless-Things/)

- Achan’s eyes led him to take what did not belong to him (Jos 7:1, 20, 21; w10 4/15 20 ¶5)
- Achan’s actions affected his family and the whole nation of Israel (Jos 7:4, 5, 24-26; w97 8/15 28 ¶2)
- We must exercise self-discipline (1Jo 2:15-17; w10 4/15 21 ¶8)

We must reject worthless things that will not exist in God’s new world of righteousness.​—2Pe 3:13.

## Joshua 8

```
Joshua sets ambush against Ai (1-13)
Ai successfully captured (14-29)
Law read at Mount Ebal (30-35)
```

#### Jos 8:29​—Why was the king of Ai hung on a stake? (it-1 1030)

Under the law given by Jehovah to Israel, certain criminals might be hung upon a stake after being put to death, as “accursed of God,” placed on public display as a warning example. A dead person thus hung was to be taken down before nightfall and buried; leaving him on the stake all night would defile the soil given to the Israelites by God. (De 21:22, 23) Israel followed this rule even if the one executed was not an Israelite.​—Jos 8:29; 10:26, 27.

## Joshua 9

```
Shrewd Gibeonites seek peace (1-15)
Gibeonites’ trick exposed (16-21)
Gibeonites to fetch wood and water (22-27)
```

### Lessons From the Account of the Gibeonites

from [workbook September–October 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-4-10-2021/Lessons-From-the-Account-of-the-Gibeonites/)

- The Gibeonites showed practical wisdom (Jos 9:3-6; it-1 930-931)
- The elders of Israel unwisely did not consult with Jehovah (Jos 9:14, 15; w11 11/15 8 ¶14)
- The Gibeonites humbly served the Israelites (Jos 9:25-27; w04 10/15 18 ¶14)

The Gibeonites performed humble tasks because they wanted to gain Jehovah’s favor. How might we show similar humility today?

## Joshua 10

```
Israel defends Gibeon (1-7)
Jehovah fights for Israel (8-15)
  Hailstones on fleeing enemies (11)
  The sun stands still (12-14)
The attacking five kings killed (16-28)
Cities in the south captured (29-43)
```

#### Jos 10:13​—Why do we not need to know what was in “the book of Jashar”? (w09 3/15 32 ¶5)

The fact that certain books were mentioned in the Bible and that they were usable sources should not lead us to conclude that they were inspired. However, Jehovah God has preserved all the writings containing “the word of our God,” and these “will last to time indefinite.” (Isa. 40:8) Yes, what Jehovah chose to include in the 66 Bible books that we have is just what we need to “be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.”​—2 Tim. 3:16, 17.

### Jehovah Fights for Israel

from [workbook September–October 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-11-17-2021/Jehovah-Fights-for-Israel/)

- Five kings joined forces against Gibeon and Israel (Jos 10:5; it-1 50)
- Jehovah fought against the coalition (Jos 10:10, 11; it-1 1020)
- Jehovah caused the sun to stand still (Jos 10:12-14; w04 12/1 11 ¶1)

When we face persecution, we trust in Jehovah to help us remain faithful. We know that with his backing, no human government can prevent us from worshipping him.

## Joshua 11

```
Cities in the north captured (1-15)
Summary of Joshua’s conquests (16-23)
```

## Joshua 12

```
Kings defeated east of the Jordan (1-6)
Kings defeated west of the Jordan (7-24)
```

## Joshua 13

```
Land yet to be conquered (1-7)
Division of the land east of the Jordan (8-14)
Reuben’s inheritance (15-23)
Gad’s inheritance (24-28)
Manasseh’s inheritance in the east (29-32)
Jehovah is Levites’ inheritance (33)
```

#### Jos 13:2, 5​—Did Israel actually receive “the land of the Gebalites”? (it-1 902-903)

Jehovah included “the land of the Gebalites” among those regions yet to be taken by Israel in Joshua’s day. (Jos 13:1-5) Critics have picked on this as an inconsistency, since the city of Gebal was far N of Israel (c. 100 km [60 mi] N of Dan) and apparently never came under Israelite domination. Certain scholars have suggested that the  Hebrew text may be damaged at this verse and consider that the account anciently read “the land adjoining Lebanon,” or ‘as far as the border of the Gebalites.’ However, it should also be observed that Jehovah’s promises in Joshua 13:2-7 were conditional. Thus Israel may never have gained Gebal because of its own disobedience.​—Compare Jos 23:12, 13.

## Joshua 14

```
Division of the land west of the Jordan (1-5)
Caleb inherits Hebron (6-15)
```

### Follow Jehovah Wholeheartedly

from [workbook September–October 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-18-24-2021/Follow-Jehovah-Wholeheartedly/)

- Caleb followed Jehovah wholeheartedly early in life (Jos 14:7, 8)
- Caleb later trusted in Jehovah to fulfill a difficult assignment (Jos 14:10-12; w04 12/1 12 ¶2)
- Caleb was rewarded for his wholehearted service to Jehovah (Jos 14:13, 14; w06 10/1 18 ¶11)

Caleb grew in faith as he followed Jehovah’s direction and experienced His blessing. We too are strengthened to continue in Jehovah’s service as we receive answers to our prayers and see his guidance in other ways.​—1Jo 5:14, 15.

## Joshua 15

```
Judah’s inheritance (1-12)
Caleb’s daughter gets land (13-19)
Cities of Judah (20-63)
```

### Protect Your Precious Inheritance

from [workbook September–October 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-25-31-2021/Protect-Your-Precious-Inheritance/)

- Caleb protected his inheritance by driving out powerful enemies (Jos 15:14; it-1 1083 ¶3)
- Not all Israelites protected their inheritance from corrupting influences (Jos 16:10; it-1 848)
- Jehovah helped those who truly wanted to protect their inheritance (De 20:1-4; Jos 17:17, 18; it-1 402 ¶3)

Jehovah offers all Christians the precious inheritance of everlasting life. To safeguard our inheritance, we strengthen ourselves against temptation by means of Bible study, Christian meetings, the field ministry, and prayer.

## Joshua 16

```
Inheritance of Joseph’s descendants (1-4)
Ephraim’s inheritance (5-10)
```

## Joshua 17

```
Manasseh’s inheritance in the west (1-13)
Additional land for Joseph’s descendants (14-18)
```

#### Jos 17:15, 18​—How do we know that ancient Israel was heavily forested? (w15 7/15 32)

THE Bible states that certain areas of the Promised Land were forested and that trees were “plentiful.” (1 Ki. 10:27; Josh. 17:15, 18) Yet, on seeing the deforested condition of large portions of the land today, skeptics may wonder if that could ever have been the case.

The book *Life in Biblical Israel* explains that “forests in ancient Israel were much more extensive than they are today.” The natural cover of the highlands consisted mainly of Aleppo pine (*Pinus halepensis*), evergreen oak (*Quercus calliprinos*), and terebinth (*Pistacia palaestina*). In the Shephelah, an area that includes the foothills between the central mountain range and the Mediterranean Coast, the sycamore fig (*Ficus sycomorus*) was also abundant.

The book *Plants of the Bible* states that some localities in Israel are now entirely devoid of trees. What contributed to this? Explaining that it was a gradual process, the book says: “Man has persistently interfered with the natural vegetation, mainly in order to expand his farming and pasture area, but also to obtain building materials and fuel for his fire.”

## Joshua 18

```
Rest of the land distributed at Shiloh (1-10)
Benjamin’s inheritance (11-28)
```

#### Jos 18:1-3​—What may have caused the Israelites to delay settling the territory west of the Jordan? (it-1 359 ¶5)

The account of the division of the territory W of the Jordan shows that first the lots for Judah (Jos 15:1-63), Joseph (Ephraim) (Jos 16:1-10), and the half tribe of Manasseh settling W of the Jordan (Jos 17:1-13) were determined, their boundaries and cities being enumerated. After this, there appears to have been an interruption of the dividing of the land, since the camp of Israel is shown to have moved from Gilgal to Shiloh. (Jos 14:6; 18:1) The length of time involved is not stated, but Joshua eventually reprimanded the remaining seven tribes for their dilatory attitude as to settling the rest of the land. (Jos 18:2, 3) Various explanations have been offered as to the cause of this attitude on the part of the seven tribes, some commentators reasoning that the abundance of spoil obtained during the conquest and the relative freedom from any immediate threat of attack by the Canaanites may have caused these tribes to feel no particular urgency about taking possession of the remaining portion of the territory. A reluctance to face up to the problem of dealing with the pockets of strong enemy resistance there may have contributed to this tardiness. (Jos 13:1-7) Also, their knowledge of this portion of the Promised Land may have been considerably more limited than of those sections already allotted.

## Joshua 19

```
Simeon’s inheritance (1-9)
Zebulun’s inheritance (10-16)
Issachar’s inheritance (17-23)
Asher’s inheritance (24-31)
Naphtali’s inheritance (32-39)
Dan’s inheritance (40-48)
Joshua’s inheritance (49-51)
```

### Jehovah’s Wise Way of Dividing the Land

from [workbook November–December 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-1-7-2021/Jehovahs-Wise-Way-of-Dividing-the-Land/)

- Jehovah gave direction by lot, perhaps to designate the approximate location of each tribal inheritance (Jos 18:10; it-1 359 ¶1)
- Jehovah ensured that Jacob’s deathbed prophecy was fulfilled (Jos 19:1; it-1 1200 ¶1)
- Jehovah allowed the people to determine the extent of each tribe’s territory (Jos 19:9; it-1 359 ¶2)

The land was divided in a way that prevented jealousy or quarreling between the tribes. What confidence does this give you about how Jehovah will direct matters in the new world?

## Joshua 20

```
Cities of refuge (1-9)
```

## Joshua 21

```
Cities for the Levites (1-42)
  For Aaron’s descendants (9-19)
  For the rest of the Kohathites (20-26)
  For the Gershonites (27-33)
  For the Merarites (34-40)
Jehovah’s promises fulfilled (43-45)
```

#### Jos 21:43, 44​—How did these words prove true even though many of the Canaanites survived the major conquest and resisted subjugation by Israel? (it-1 402 ¶3)

Though so many of the Canaanites survived the major conquest and resisted subjugation, it could still be said that “Jehovah gave Israel all the land that he had sworn to give to their forefathers,” that he had given them “rest all around,” and that “not a promise failed out of all the good promise that Jehovah had made to the house of Israel; it all came true.” (Jos 21:43-45) All around the Israelites the enemy peoples were cowed and offered no genuine threat to their security. God had stated earlier that he would drive the Canaanites out “little by little” so that the wild beasts would not multiply in a suddenly desolated land. (Ex 23:29, 30; De 7:22) Despite the superior war equipment of the Canaanites, including war chariots with iron scythes, any failure of the Israelites finally to take certain areas could not be charged to Jehovah’s account as a failure on his part to fulfill his promise. (Jos 17:16-18; Jg 4:13) Rather, the record shows that the Israelites’ few defeats were due to unfaithfulness on their part.​—Nu 14:44, 45; Jos 7:1-12.

## Joshua 22

```
Eastern tribes return home (1-8)
Altar built at the Jordan (9-12)
Meaning of the altar explained (13-29)
Conflict settled (30-34)
```

### Lessons From a Misunderstanding

from [workbook November–December 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-8-14-2021/Lessons-From-a-Misunderstanding/)

- The tribes living east of the Jordan built a large, impressive altar (Jos 22:10)
- The other tribes accused them of unfaithfulness (Jos 22:12, 15, 16; w06 4/15 5 ¶3)
- The mild response of those wrongfully accused averted bloodshed (Jos 22:21-30; w08 11/15 18 ¶5)

What does this account teach us about how to react if we are wrongfully accused and about the importance of not drawing conclusions when we do not know the facts?​—Pr 15:1; 18:13.

## Joshua 23

```
Joshua’s farewell to Israel’s leaders (1-16)
  None of Jehovah’s words failed (14)
```

### Joshua’s Final Admonition to the Nation

from [workbook November–December 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-15-21-2021/Joshuas-Final-Admonition-to-the-Nation/)

- “Be on guard constantly by loving Jehovah” (Jos 23:11)
- Do not mingle with the nations (Jos 23:12, 13; it-1 75)
- Trust Jehovah (Jos 23:14; w07 11/1 26 ¶19-20)

How will following Joshua’s inspired advice help us remain faithful to Jehovah?

## Joshua 24

```
Joshua reviews Israel’s history (1-13)
Exhortation to serve Jehovah (14-24)
  “As for me and my household, we will serve Jehovah” (15)
Joshua’s covenant with Israel (25-28)
Joshua’s death and burial (29-31)
Joseph’s bones buried at Shechem (32)
Eleazar’s death and burial (33)
```

#### Jos 24:2​—Was Abraham’s father, Terah, a worshipper of idols? (w04 12/1 12 ¶1)

Initially, Terah was not a worshiper of Jehovah God. He likely worshiped the moon-god named Sin​—a popular deity in Ur. According to Jewish tradition, Terah might even have been a maker of idols. However, when Abraham leaves Ur at God’s command, Terah goes with him to Haran.​—Genesis 11:31.
