### Turn Away From Worthless Things

from [workbook September–October 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-october-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-27-October-3-2021/Turn-Away-From-Worthless-Things/)

- Achan’s eyes led him to take what did not belong to him (Jos 7:1, 20, 21; w10 4/15 20 ¶5)
- Achan’s actions affected his family and the whole nation of Israel (Jos 7:4, 5, 24-26; w97 8/15 28 ¶2)
- We must exercise self-discipline (1Jo 2:15-17; w10 4/15 21 ¶8)

We must reject worthless things that will not exist in God’s new world of righteousness.​—2Pe 3:13.
