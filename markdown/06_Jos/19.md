### Jehovah’s Wise Way of Dividing the Land

from [workbook November–December 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-1-7-2021/Jehovahs-Wise-Way-of-Dividing-the-Land/)

- Jehovah gave direction by lot, perhaps to designate the approximate location of each tribal inheritance (Jos 18:10; it-1 359 ¶1)
- Jehovah ensured that Jacob’s deathbed prophecy was fulfilled (Jos 19:1; it-1 1200 ¶1)
- Jehovah allowed the people to determine the extent of each tribe’s territory (Jos 19:9; it-1 359 ¶2)

The land was divided in a way that prevented jealousy or quarreling between the tribes. What confidence does this give you about how Jehovah will direct matters in the new world?
