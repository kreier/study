#### Jos 13:2, 5​—Did Israel actually receive “the land of the Gebalites”? (it-1 902-903)

Jehovah included “the land of the Gebalites” among those regions yet to be taken by Israel in Joshua’s day. (Jos 13:1-5) Critics have picked on this as an inconsistency, since the city of Gebal was far N of Israel (c. 100 km [60 mi] N of Dan) and apparently never came under Israelite domination. Certain scholars have suggested that the  Hebrew text may be damaged at this verse and consider that the account anciently read “the land adjoining Lebanon,” or ‘as far as the border of the Gebalites.’ However, it should also be observed that Jehovah’s promises in Joshua 13:2-7 were conditional. Thus Israel may never have gained Gebal because of its own disobedience.​—Compare Jos 23:12, 13.
