#### Jos 24:2​—Was Abraham’s father, Terah, a worshipper of idols? (w04 12/1 12 ¶1)

Initially, Terah was not a worshiper of Jehovah God. He likely worshiped the moon-god named Sin​—a popular deity in Ur. According to Jewish tradition, Terah might even have been a maker of idols. However, when Abraham leaves Ur at God’s command, Terah goes with him to Haran.​—Genesis 11:31.
