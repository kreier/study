## Joshua 5

```
Circumcision at Gilgal (1-9)
Passover celebrated; manna stops (10-12)
Prince of Jehovah’s army (13-15)
```

#### Jos 5:14, 15, ftn.​—Who is thought to be the “chief of Jehovah’s army”? (w04 12/1 9 ¶2)

The prince who comes to strengthen Joshua as the conquest of the Promised Land begins is likely none other than “the Word”​—Jesus Christ in his prehuman existence. (John 1:1; Daniel 10:13) How strengthening it is to have the assurance that the glorified Jesus Christ is with God’s people today as they engage in spiritual warfare!
