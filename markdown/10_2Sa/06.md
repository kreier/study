## 2 Samuel 6

```
The Ark brought to Jerusalem (1-23)
  Uzzah grabs the Ark and is killed (6-8)
  Michal despises David (16, 20-23)
```

#### 2Sa 6:8, 9​—What do we learn from David’s reaction to Jehovah’s wrath? (w96 4/1 29 ¶1)

David as king had to bear some responsibility for this. His reaction shows that even those who have a good relationship with Jehovah can occasionally react badly to trialsome situations. First David became angry. Then he grew afraid. (2 Samuel 6:8, 9) His trusting relationship with Jehovah was severely tested. Here was an occasion when seemingly he failed to throw his burden on Jehovah, when he did not follow his commands. Might that be the situation with us sometimes? Do we ever blame Jehovah for problems that result because we ignore his instructions?—Proverbs 19:3.
