### Do Not Let Improper Desires Control You

from [workbook May–June 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-13-19-2022/Do-Not-Let-Improper-Desires-Control-You/)

- David allowed an improper desire to develop in his heart (2Sa 11:2-4; w21.06 17 ¶10)
- David misused his power to cover up his wrongdoing (2Sa 11:5, 14, 15; w19.09 17 ¶15)
- David suffered terrible consequences for his sin (2Sa 12:9-12; w18.06 17 ¶7)

To avoid looking at or thinking about improper things, we need self-discipline. (Ga 5:16, 22, 23) Jehovah can help us not to allow improper desires to take root in our heart.
