## 2 Samuel 23

```
David’s last words (1-7)
Exploits of David’s mighty warriors (8-39)
```

#### 2Sa 23:15-17​—Why did David refuse to drink the water? (w05 5/15 19 ¶6)

David had such a deep respect for God’s law on life and blood that on this occasion, he refrained from doing what even resembled a violation of that law. We must cultivate such an attitude toward all of God’s commands.
