#### 2Sa 14:25, 26​—What does Absalom’s example teach us about true beauty? (g04 12/22 8-9)

By way of contrast, consider Absalom, one of David’s sons. He turned out to be an undesirable man in spite of his enviable appearance. The Bible says of him: “Now compared with Absalom there proved to be no man so beautiful in all Israel as to be praised so much. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there proved to be no defect in him.” (2 Samuel 14:25) However, Absalom’s ambition impelled him to rebel against his own father and usurp the throne. He even violated his father’s concubines. As a result,  Absalom incurred divine wrath and suffered a painful death.​—2 Samuel 15:10-14; 16:13-22; 17:14; 18:9, 15.

Do you feel drawn to Absalom? Of course not. All in all, he was a repulsive individual. His outstanding physical beauty did not compensate for his arrogance and disloyalty, nor did it prevent his ruin. On the other hand, the Bible contains many examples of wise, appealing people about whom nothing is said of their physical appearance. Evidently, what mattered most was their inner beauty.
