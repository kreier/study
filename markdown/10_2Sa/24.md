### Is Your Giving a Sacrifice?

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-25-31-2022/Is-Your-Giving-a-Sacrifice/)

- David was instructed to set up an altar on the threshing floor of Araunah (2Sa 24:18)
- Araunah graciously offered to donate the land and sacrificial animals (2Sa 24:21-23)
- David would not offer sacrifices that cost him nothing (2Sa 24:24, 25; it-1 146)

Jehovah is pleased when we willingly sacrifice our time, energy, and resources in order to promote Kingdom interests. (w12 1/15 18 ¶8) What goals could you set to increase your “sacrifice of praise” to him?​—Heb 13:15.
