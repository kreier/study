### What Do We Learn From “The Bow”?

from [workbook May–June 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-May-16-22-2022/What-Do-We-Learn-From-The-Bow/)

- Show respect for those in authority (2Sa 1:17, 18, 23, 24; w00 6/15 13 ¶9)
- Show loyalty to friends (2Sa 1:25, 26; w12 4/15 10 ¶8)

**ASK YOURSELF:** ‘How can I show respect for the congregation elders? How can I show loyalty to fellow Christians?’

## 2 Samuel 2

```
David, king over Judah (1-7)
Ish-bosheth, king over Israel (8-11)
War between David’s house and Saul’s house (12-32)
```

#### 2Sa 1:26​—Why could David call Jonathan “my brother”? (it-1 369 ¶2)

“Brother” is also applied to those united in a general cause and having similar aims and purposes. For example, King Hiram of Tyre called King Solomon his brother, not simply because he was an equal in rank and position but also perhaps because of mutual interests in supplying timbers and other things for the temple. (1Ki 9:13; 5:1-12) “Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” David wrote, implying that it is not blood relations alone that make for peace and unity between fleshly brothers. (Ps 133:1) In fact, mutual affection and interest, not common parentage, prompted David to call Jonathan his brother. (2Sa 1:26) Companions having similar natures and dispositions, even when such are bad, are properly called brothers.​—Pr 18:9.

## 2 Samuel 3

```
David’s house grows stronger (1)
David’s sons (2-5)
Abner defects to David (6-21)
Joab kills Abner (22-30)
David mourns for Abner (31-39)
```

## 2 Samuel 4

```
Ish-bosheth assassinated (1-8)
David has the assassins killed (9-12)
```

## 2 Samuel 5

```
David made king over all Israel (1-5)
Jerusalem captured (6-16)
  Zion, the City of David (7)
David defeats the Philistines (17-25)
```

## 2 Samuel 6

```
The Ark brought to Jerusalem (1-23)
  Uzzah grabs the Ark and is killed (6-8)
  Michal despises David (16, 20-23)
```

#### 2Sa 6:8, 9​—What do we learn from David’s reaction to Jehovah’s wrath? (w96 4/1 29 ¶1)

David as king had to bear some responsibility for this. His reaction shows that even those who have a good relationship with Jehovah can occasionally react badly to trialsome situations. First David became angry. Then he grew afraid. (2 Samuel 6:8, 9) His trusting relationship with Jehovah was severely tested. Here was an occasion when seemingly he failed to throw his burden on Jehovah, when he did not follow his commands. Might that be the situation with us sometimes? Do we ever blame Jehovah for problems that result because we ignore his instructions?—Proverbs 19:3.

### Maintain a Healthy Fear of Displeasing Jehovah

from [workbook May–June 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-May-23-29-2022/Maintain-a-Healthy-Fear-of-Displeasing-Jehovah/)

- Good intentions do not change what Jehovah requires (2Sa 6:3-5; w05 5/15 17 ¶8)
- Uzzah violated God’s Law (2Sa 6:6; w05 2/1 27 ¶20)
- Jehovah punished Uzzah for his irreverent act (2Sa 6:7; w05 2/1 27 ¶21)

## 2 Samuel 7

```
David not to build the temple (1-7)
Covenant with David for a kingdom (8-17)
David’s prayer of thanksgiving (18-29)
```

### Jehovah Makes a Covenant With David

from [workbook May–June 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-May-30-June-5-2022/Jehovah-Makes-a-Covenant-With-David/)

- Jehovah decreed that he would make a dynasty for David (2Sa 7:11, 12, ftn.; w10 4/1 20 ¶3; see cover picture)
- Aspects of Jehovah’s covenant with David were fulfilled in the Messiah (2Sa 7:13, 14; Heb 1:5; w10 4/1 20 ¶4)
- The Messiah’s accomplishments will last forever (2Sa 7:15, 16; Heb 1:8; w14 10/15 10 ¶14)

The sun and moon are fitting reminders of the permanence of the Messiah’s rule. (Ps 89:35-37) When you see them, think about the blessings that Jehovah has promised to you and your family through His Kingdom.

## 2 Samuel 8

```
David’s victories (1-14)
David’s administration (15-18)
```

#### 2Sa 8:2​—How did David’s defeat of the Moabites fulfill prophecy? (it-2 206 ¶2)

**Balaam’s Prophecy.** It was before the Israelites entered the Promised Land that the prophet Balaam said to Moab’s King Balak: “Do come, let me advise you what this people [Israel] will do to your people afterward in the end of the days. . . . A star will certainly step forth out of Jacob, and a scepter will indeed rise out of Israel. And he will certainly break apart the temples of Moab’s head and the cranium of all the sons of tumult of war.” (Nu 24:14-17) In the initial fulfillment of this prophecy, the “star” proved to be King David, the subduer of the Moabites. (2Sa 8:2) Evidently, therefore, in that fulfillment of this particular prophecy, “the end of the days” began with David’s becoming king. Since David foreshadowed Jesus as Messianic King, the prophecy would also apply to Jesus at the time when he subdues his enemies.​—Isa 9:7; Ps 2:8, 9.

## 2 Samuel 9

```
David’s loyal love for Mephibosheth (1-13)
```

### David Showed Loyal Love

from [workbook May–June 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-6-12-2022/David-Showed-Loyal-Love/)

- David searched for someone to whom he could show loyal love (2Sa 9:1; w06 6/15 14 ¶6)
- David acted immediately to help Mephibosheth (1Sa 20:15, 42; 2Sa 9:5-7; w05 5/15 17 ¶12)
- David assigned Ziba to care for Mephibosheth’s inheritance (2Sa 9:9, 10; w02 2/15 14 ¶10)

David did not forget his promise to Jonathan. We should show loyal love to fellow believers.​—Ps 41:1, 2; Pr 19:17.

## 2 Samuel 10

```
Victories over Ammon and Syria (1-19)
```

#### 2Sa 10:4, 5​—Why were Hanun’s actions such an insult to Israelite men? (it-1 266)

Among many ancient peoples of the East, including the Israelites, a beard was cherished as an evidence of manly dignity. God’s law to Israel prohibited the cutting off of the “sidelocks,” the hair between the ear and the eye, and the extremity of the beard. (Le 19:27; 21:5) This was doubtless because among some pagans it was a religious practice.

## 2 Samuel 11

```
David’s adultery with Bath-sheba (1-13)
David arranges to have Uriah killed (14-25)
David takes Bath-sheba as wife (26, 27)
```

### Do Not Let Improper Desires Control You

from [workbook May–June 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-13-19-2022/Do-Not-Let-Improper-Desires-Control-You/)

- David allowed an improper desire to develop in his heart (2Sa 11:2-4; w21.06 17 ¶10)
- David misused his power to cover up his wrongdoing (2Sa 11:5, 14, 15; w19.09 17 ¶15)
- David suffered terrible consequences for his sin (2Sa 12:9-12; w18.06 17 ¶7)

To avoid looking at or thinking about improper things, we need self-discipline. (Ga 5:16, 22, 23) Jehovah can help us not to allow improper desires to take root in our heart.

## 2 Samuel 12

```
Nathan reproves David (1-15a)
Bath-sheba’s son dies (15b-23)
Bath-sheba bears Solomon (24, 25)
Ammonite city of Rabbah captured (26-31)
```

#### 2Sa 12:13​—What are some reasons why Jehovah did not have David and Bath-sheba put to death? (it-1 590 ¶1)

Jehovah was watching, however, and uncovered the whole reprehensible matter. If Jehovah had permitted the case involving David and Bath-sheba to be handled by human judges under the Mosaic Law, both of the wrongdoers would have been put to death, and of course, the unborn offspring of their adultery would have died with the mother. (De 5:18; 22:22) However, Jehovah dealt with the case himself and showed mercy to David because of the Kingdom covenant (2Sa 7:11-16), no doubt because David himself had shown mercy (1Sa 24:4-7; compare Jas 2:13) and because of repentance that God observed on the part of the wrongdoers. (Ps 51:1-4) But they did not escape all punishment. By the mouth of the prophet Nathan, Jehovah pronounced: “Here I am raising up against you calamity out of your own house.”​—2Sa 12:1-12.

## 2 Samuel 13

```
Amnon rapes Tamar (1-22)
Absalom kills Amnon (23-33)
Absalom flees to Geshur (34-39)
```

### Amnon’s Selfishness Led to Tragedy

from [workbook May–June 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-20-26-2022/Amnons-Selfishness-Led-to-Tragedy/)

- Amnon became infatuated with Tamar (2Sa 13:1, 2; it-1 32)
- Amnon raped Tamar (2Sa 13:10-15; w17.09 5 ¶11)
- Absalom had Amnon killed (2Sa 13:28, 29; it-1 33 ¶1)

How can dating couples avoid tragedy? Showing self-control, they wisely avoid places and circumstances that could lead to wrongdoing.

## 2 Samuel 14

```
Joab and the Tekoite woman (1-17)
David detects Joab’s scheme (18-20)
Absalom allowed to return (21-33)
```

#### 2Sa 14:25, 26​—What does Absalom’s example teach us about true beauty? (g04 12/22 8-9)

By way of contrast, consider Absalom, one of David’s sons. He turned out to be an undesirable man in spite of his enviable appearance. The Bible says of him: “Now compared with Absalom there proved to be no man so beautiful in all Israel as to be praised so much. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there proved to be no defect in him.” (2 Samuel 14:25) However, Absalom’s ambition impelled him to rebel against his own father and usurp the throne. He even violated his father’s concubines. As a result,  Absalom incurred divine wrath and suffered a painful death.​—2 Samuel 15:10-14; 16:13-22; 17:14; 18:9, 15.

Do you feel drawn to Absalom? Of course not. All in all, he was a repulsive individual. His outstanding physical beauty did not compensate for his arrogance and disloyalty, nor did it prevent his ruin. On the other hand, the Bible contains many examples of wise, appealing people about whom nothing is said of their physical appearance. Evidently, what mattered most was their inner beauty.

## 2 Samuel 15

```
Absalom’s conspiracy and revolt (1-12)
David flees Jerusalem (13-30)
Ahithophel joins Absalom (31)
Hushai sent to counteract Ahithophel (32-37)
```

### Absalom Rebelled Because of Pride

from [workbook May–June 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-27-July-3-2022/Absalom-Rebelled-Because-of-Pride/)

- Absalom sought glory for himself (2Sa 15:1; it-1 860)
- Absalom stole the hearts of the people (2Sa 15:2-6; w12 7/15 13 ¶5)
- Absalom tried to seize his father’s kingship (2Sa 15:10-12; it-1 1083-1084)

We must not allow ambition to take root in our heart. Rather, we should regularly examine our motives. Instead of seeking to impress others, we sincerely look out for their interests.​—Php 2:3, 4.

## 2 Samuel 16

```
Ziba slanders Mephibosheth (1-4)
Shimei curses David (5-14)
Absalom receives Hushai (15-19)
Ahithophel’s advice (20-23)
```

#### 2Sa 16:4​—What does David’s rash decision teach us? (w18.08 6 ¶11)

As individuals, we may also become victims of injustice because half-truths or incomplete information is circulated about us. Consider the example of King David and Mephibosheth. David showed generosity and kindness to Mephibosheth, returning to him all the land of his grandfather Saul. (2 Sam. 9:6, 7) Later, however, David received a negative report about Mephibosheth. Without verifying the information, David decided to strip Mephibosheth of all his property. (2 Sam. 16:1-4) When David finally spoke with him, David recognized his error and restored to Mephibosheth a share of the property. (2 Sam. 19:24-29) But this injustice could have been avoided had David taken the time to get the facts instead of rashly acting on incomplete information.

## 2 Samuel 17

```
Hushai thwarts Ahithophel’s advice (1-14)
David is warned; he escapes Absalom (15-29)
  Barzillai and others provide supplies (27-29)
```

## 2 Samuel 18

```
Absalom’s defeat and death (1-18)
David informed of Absalom’s death (19-33)
```

## 2 Samuel 19

```
David mourns for Absalom (1-4)
Joab reproves David (5-8a)
David returns to Jerusalem (8b-15)
Shimei asks for forgiveness (16-23)
Mephibosheth proved innocent (24-30)
Barzillai honored (31-40)
Dispute among the tribes (41-43)
```

#### 2Sa 19:24-30​—How can we draw strength from Mephibosheth’s example? (w20.04 30 ¶19)

If you live with limitations and feel that you are misunderstood, you may be able to draw strength from the example of Mephibosheth. (2 Sam. 4:4) He had to deal with being infirm, and he was misjudged by King David. Mephibosheth did nothing to bring these trials on himself. Yet, he did not allow himself to become negative; he appreciated the positive things in his life. He was thankful for the kindness David had shown him in the past. (2 Sam. 9:6-10) So when David misjudged him, Mephibosheth saw the complete picture. He did not allow David’s mistake to make him bitter. And he did not blame Jehovah for what David had done. Mephibosheth focused on  what he could do to support Jehovah’s appointed king. (2 Sam. 16:1-4; 19:24-30) Jehovah had Mephibosheth’s excellent example recorded in His Word for our benefit.​—Rom. 15:4.

### Barzillai—An Example of Modesty

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-4-10-2022/Barzillai-An-Example-of-Modesty/)

- Barzillai was offered a privilege by King David (2Sa 19:32, 33; w07 7/15 14 ¶5)
- Modesty moved Barzillai to decline the offer respectfully (2Sa 19:34, 35; w07 7/15 14 ¶7)
- Be modest like Barzillai (w07 7/15 15 ¶1-2)

Modesty makes us aware of our limitations. We must be modest in order to please Jehovah. (Mic 6:8) How do we benefit when we display this quality?

## 2 Samuel 20

```
Sheba’s revolt; Joab kills Amasa (1-13)
Sheba pursued and beheaded (14-22)
David’s administration (23-26)
```

## 2 Samuel 21

```
Gibeonites avenged on Saul’s house (1-14)
Wars against the Philistines (15-22)
```

#### 2Sa 21:15-17​—What lessons can we draw from this account? (w13 1/15 31 ¶14)

Worldwide, we as Jehovah’s people are carrying out our ministry despite the obstacles that Satan and his agents place in our path. Some of us have stood face-to-face with giant challenges, but with full reliance on Jehovah, we took on those “Goliaths” and conquered them. However, at times, the constant battle against the pressures of this world leaves us tired and discouraged. In that weakened condition, we are vulnerable and in danger of being ‘struck down’ by pressures we otherwise would have dealt with successfully. At such moments, the timely support given by an elder can help us to regain our joy and our strength, as many have experienced. A pioneer in her mid-60’s related: “Some time ago, I did not feel well, and field service tired me out. An elder noticed my lack of energy and approached me. We had an encouraging conversation based on a Bible passage. I applied the suggestions he gave me, and I benefited.” She added: “How loving of that elder to take note of my weak condition and to give me help!” Yes, it is heartening to know that we have elders who keep a loving eye on us and who, much like Abishai of old, stand ready to ‘come to our help.’

### Jehovah Is a God of Justice

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-11-17-2022/Jehovah-Is-a-God-of-Justice/)

- Jehovah did not forget the injustice committed against the Gibeonites (2Sa 21:1, 2)
- Silver and gold could not atone for the bloodguilt of Saul and his household (Nu 35:31, 33; 2Sa 21:3, 4)
- Seven of Saul’s descendants were executed to satisfy justice (2Sa 21:5, 6; it-1 932 ¶1)

How can Romans 12:19-21 help us when we are victims of unjust treatment?

## 2 Samuel 22

```
David praises God for his acts of salvation (1-51)
  “Jehovah is my crag” (2)
  Jehovah loyal to the loyal ones (26)
```

#### 2Sa 22:36​—How did Jehovah’s humility make David great? (w12 11/15 17 ¶7)

God’s example of humility had a tremendous effect on the psalmist David. He sang to Jehovah: “You will give me your shield of salvation, and it is your humility that makes me great.” (2 Sam. 22:36) David attributed any greatness he had in Israel to Jehovah’s humility​—to God’s condescending, or humbling himself, to pay attention to him. (Ps. 113:5-7) Is it any different with us? In the way of qualities, abilities, and privileges, what do any of us have that we “did not receive” from Jehovah? (1 Cor. 4:7) The person who conducts himself as a lesser one is “great” in that he becomes more valuable as a servant of Jehovah. (Luke 9:48, ftn.) Let us reflect on how this is so.

### Rely On Jehovah for Help

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-18-24-2022/Rely-On-Jehovah-for-Help/)

- Jehovah hears our cries for help (2Sa 22:7)
- Jehovah is stronger than any enemy (2Sa 22:14-18; cl 19 ¶11)
- Jehovah loyally acts in our behalf (2Sa 22:26; w10 6/1 26 ¶4-6)

Jehovah has the ability to remove our trials. However, in most cases, he helps us to cope with them by means of his holy spirit, his Word, and our Christian brotherhood. (Ps 55:22) In what ways can we avail ourselves of God’s help?

## 2 Samuel 23

```
David’s last words (1-7)
Exploits of David’s mighty warriors (8-39)
```

#### 2Sa 23:15-17​—Why did David refuse to drink the water? (w05 5/15 19 ¶6)

David had such a deep respect for God’s law on life and blood that on this occasion, he refrained from doing what even resembled a violation of that law. We must cultivate such an attitude toward all of God’s commands.

## 2 Samuel 24

```
David’s census sin (1-14)
Pestilence kills 70,000 (15-17)
David builds an altar (18-25)
  No sacrifices without cost (24)
```

### Is Your Giving a Sacrifice?

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-25-31-2022/Is-Your-Giving-a-Sacrifice/)

- David was instructed to set up an altar on the threshing floor of Araunah (2Sa 24:18)
- Araunah graciously offered to donate the land and sacrificial animals (2Sa 24:21-23)
- David would not offer sacrifices that cost him nothing (2Sa 24:24, 25; it-1 146)

Jehovah is pleased when we willingly sacrifice our time, energy, and resources in order to promote Kingdom interests. (w12 1/15 18 ¶8) What goals could you set to increase your “sacrifice of praise” to him?​—Heb 13:15.
