#### 2Sa 19:24-30​—How can we draw strength from Mephibosheth’s example? (w20.04 30 ¶19)

If you live with limitations and feel that you are misunderstood, you may be able to draw strength from the example of Mephibosheth. (2 Sam. 4:4) He had to deal with being infirm, and he was misjudged by King David. Mephibosheth did nothing to bring these trials on himself. Yet, he did not allow himself to become negative; he appreciated the positive things in his life. He was thankful for the kindness David had shown him in the past. (2 Sam. 9:6-10) So when David misjudged him, Mephibosheth saw the complete picture. He did not allow David’s mistake to make him bitter. And he did not blame Jehovah for what David had done. Mephibosheth focused on  what he could do to support Jehovah’s appointed king. (2 Sam. 16:1-4; 19:24-30) Jehovah had Mephibosheth’s excellent example recorded in His Word for our benefit.​—Rom. 15:4.

### Barzillai—An Example of Modesty

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-4-10-2022/Barzillai-An-Example-of-Modesty/)

- Barzillai was offered a privilege by King David (2Sa 19:32, 33; w07 7/15 14 ¶5)
- Modesty moved Barzillai to decline the offer respectfully (2Sa 19:34, 35; w07 7/15 14 ¶7)
- Be modest like Barzillai (w07 7/15 15 ¶1-2)

Modesty makes us aware of our limitations. We must be modest in order to please Jehovah. (Mic 6:8) How do we benefit when we display this quality?
