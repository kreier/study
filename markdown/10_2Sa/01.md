### What Do We Learn From “The Bow”?

from [workbook May–June 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-May-16-22-2022/What-Do-We-Learn-From-The-Bow/)

- Show respect for those in authority (2Sa 1:17, 18, 23, 24; w00 6/15 13 ¶9)
- Show loyalty to friends (2Sa 1:25, 26; w12 4/15 10 ¶8)

**ASK YOURSELF:** ‘How can I show respect for the congregation elders? How can I show loyalty to fellow Christians?’
