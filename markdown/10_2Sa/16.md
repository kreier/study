#### 2Sa 16:4​—What does David’s rash decision teach us? (w18.08 6 ¶11)

As individuals, we may also become victims of injustice because half-truths or incomplete information is circulated about us. Consider the example of King David and Mephibosheth. David showed generosity and kindness to Mephibosheth, returning to him all the land of his grandfather Saul. (2 Sam. 9:6, 7) Later, however, David received a negative report about Mephibosheth. Without verifying the information, David decided to strip Mephibosheth of all his property. (2 Sam. 16:1-4) When David finally spoke with him, David recognized his error and restored to Mephibosheth a share of the property. (2 Sam. 19:24-29) But this injustice could have been avoided had David taken the time to get the facts instead of rashly acting on incomplete information.
