## 2 Samuel 22

```
David praises God for his acts of salvation (1-51)
  “Jehovah is my crag” (2)
  Jehovah loyal to the loyal ones (26)
```

#### 2Sa 22:36​—How did Jehovah’s humility make David great? (w12 11/15 17 ¶7)

God’s example of humility had a tremendous effect on the psalmist David. He sang to Jehovah: “You will give me your shield of salvation, and it is your humility that makes me great.” (2 Sam. 22:36) David attributed any greatness he had in Israel to Jehovah’s humility​—to God’s condescending, or humbling himself, to pay attention to him. (Ps. 113:5-7) Is it any different with us? In the way of qualities, abilities, and privileges, what do any of us have that we “did not receive” from Jehovah? (1 Cor. 4:7) The person who conducts himself as a lesser one is “great” in that he becomes more valuable as a servant of Jehovah. (Luke 9:48, ftn.) Let us reflect on how this is so.

### Rely On Jehovah for Help

- Jehovah hears our cries for help (2Sa 22:7)
- Jehovah is stronger than any enemy (2Sa 22:14-18; cl 19 ¶11)
- Jehovah loyally acts in our behalf (2Sa 22:26; w10 6/1 26 ¶4-6)

Jehovah has the ability to remove our trials. However, in most cases, he helps us to cope with them by means of his holy spirit, his Word, and our Christian brotherhood. (Ps 55:22) In what ways can we avail ourselves of God’s help?
