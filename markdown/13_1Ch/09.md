#### 1Ch 9:33​—How does this verse help us to appreciate the importance of music in true worship? (w10 12/15 21 ¶6)

Yes, through his prophets, Jehovah directed his worshippers to praise him with song. Singers from the priestly tribe were even exempted from duties that other Levites were required to perform so that they could devote sufficient time to composition and, most likely, to rehearsal.​—1 Chron. 9:33.
