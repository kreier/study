#### 1Ch 27:33​—How is Hushai a good example of a loyal friend? (w17.03 29 ¶6-7)

David had other associates who loyally stood by him in difficult times. One such associate was Hushai, whom the Bible refers to as “David’s friend.” (2 Sam. 16:16; 1 Chron. 27:33) He may have been a court official who was a personal friend and companion to the king, one who at times carried out confidential orders.

When David’s son Absalom usurped the throne, many Israelites took Absalom’s side, but not Hushai. While David was fleeing, Hushai went to him. David felt deeply hurt because of being betrayed by his own son and by some whom he had trusted. However, Hushai remained loyal, as one who was willing to risk his life and accomplish a mission that would thwart the conspiracy. Hushai did not simply do so out of a sense of duty as a court official. He proved to be a loyal friend.—2 Sam. 15:13-17, 32-37; 16:15–17:16.
