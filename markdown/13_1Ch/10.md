### Strengthen Your Desire to Do God’s Will

from [workbook January–February 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-6-12-2023/Strengthen-Your-Desire-to-Do-Gods-Will/)

- Because Saul was disobedient, Jehovah rejected him (1Ch 10:13, 14)
- Jehovah chose David to become king in Saul’s place (1Ch 11:3)
- Unlike Saul, David let himself be guided by Jehovah’s laws and principles (1Ch 11:15-19; w12 11/15 6 ¶12-13)

David loved doing God’s will. (Ps 40:8) We can cultivate a similar desire to do what is right by learning to view things the way Jehovah does.​—Ps 25:4; w18.06 17 ¶5-6.
