#### 1Ch 12:33​—What good example did the 50,000 men of Zebulun set? (it-1 1058 ¶5-6)

**Serving With “a Complete Heart.”** The literal heart must be whole to function normally, but the figurative heart can be divided. David prayed: “*Unify my heart* to fear your name,” suggesting that a person’s heart could be divided with regard to its affections and fears. (Ps 86:11) Such a person may be “halfhearted”​—lukewarmly worshiping God. (Ps 119:113; Re 3:16) An individual can also be of “a double heart” (literally, with a heart and a heart), trying to serve two masters, or deceptively saying one thing while thinking something else. (1Ch 12:33; Ps 12:2, ftn) Jesus strongly denounced such doublehearted hypocrisy.​—Mt 15:7, 8.

One seeking to please God must be neither halfhearted nor doublehearted but must serve him with a *complete* heart. (1Ch 28:9) This requires diligent effort in view of the heart’s being desperate and inclined to badness. (Jer 17:9, 10; Ge 8:21) Of help in maintaining a complete heart are: heartfelt prayer (Ps 119:145; La 3:41), regular study of God’s Word (Ezr 7:10; Pr 15:28), zealous participation in preaching the good news (compare Jer 20:9), and association with others whose hearts are complete toward Jehovah.​—Compare 2Ki 10:15, 16.
