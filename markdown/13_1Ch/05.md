#### 1Ch 5:10​—How can the victory over the Hagrites encourage us when we face seemingly insurmountable obstacles? (w05 10/1 9 ¶7)

In the days of King Saul, the tribes east of the Jordan defeated the Hagrites even though these tribes were outnumbered more than 2 to 1. This was because the valiant men of these tribes trusted in Jehovah and looked to him for help. Let us have complete confidence in Jehovah as we carry on our spiritual warfare against formidable odds.​—Ephesians 6:10-17.
