### The Bible—A Book of Fact, Not Fiction

from [workbook January–February 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-January-16-22-2023/The-Bible-A-Book-of-Fact-Not-Fiction/)

- Adam was a real person (1Ch 1:1; w09 9/1 14 ¶1)
- Noah was also a real person (1Ch 1:4; w08 6/1 3 ¶4)

When we understand that people in the Bible are, not mythical characters, but real people, we better appreciate the lessons we learn from their example.​—1Co 15:22; w09 9/1 14-15.

## 1 Chronicles 2

```
Israel’s 12 sons (1, 2)
Descendants of Judah (3-55)
```

## 1 Chronicles 3

```
Descendants of David (1-9)
Royal line of David (10-24)
```

#### 1Ch 3:1-3​—Why were women occasionally named in genealogical registers? (it-1 911 ¶3-4)

Women were named in the genealogical registers occasionally when there was a historical reason to do so. At Genesis 11:29, 30, Sarai (Sarah) is mentioned, evidently for the reason that the promised Seed was to come through her, not through another wife of Abraham. Milcah may have been named in the same passage because she was the grandmother of Rebekah, Isaac’s wife, thereby showing Rebekah’s lineage as being from Abraham’s relatives, since Isaac was not to have a wife from the other nations. (Ge 22:20-23; 24:2-4) At Genesis 25:1, the name of Abraham’s later wife Keturah is given. This shows that Abraham married again after Sarah died and that his reproductive powers were still alive more than 40 years after their miraculous renewal by Jehovah. (Ro 4:19; Ge 24:67; 25:20) Also, it reveals the relationship of Midian and other Arabian tribes to Israel.

Leah, Rachel, and Jacob’s concubines, together with the sons they bore, are named. (Ge 35:21-26) This helps us to understand God’s later dealings with these sons. For similar reasons we find the names of other women in the genealogical registers. When an inheritance was transmitted through them, their names might be included. (Nu 26:33) Of course, Tamar, Rahab, and Ruth are outstanding. In each case, there is something remarkable about the manner in which these women came to be in the line of ancestry of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. (Ge 38; Ru 1:3-5; 4:13-15; Mt 1:1-5) Among other instances of the mention of women in the genealogical lists are 1 Chronicles 2:35, 48, 49; 3:1-3, 5.

## 1 Chronicles 4

```
Other descendants of Judah (1-23)
  Jabez and his prayer (9, 10)
Descendants of Simeon (24-43)
```

### What Do My Prayers Reveal About Me?

from [workbook January–February 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-January-23-29-2023/What-Do-My-Prayers-Reveal-About-Me/)

- Jabez was an honorable man (1Ch 4:9)
- His prayer revealed his concern for true worship (1Ch 4:10a; w10 10/1 23 ¶3-7)
- Jehovah answered Jabez’ prayer (1Ch 4:10b)

## 1 Chronicles 5

```
Descendants of Reuben (1-10)
Descendants of Gad (11-17)
Hagrites are conquered (18-22)
Half tribe of Manasseh (23-26)
```

#### 1Ch 5:10​—How can the victory over the Hagrites encourage us when we face seemingly insurmountable obstacles? (w05 10/1 9 ¶7)

In the days of King Saul, the tribes east of the Jordan defeated the Hagrites even though these tribes were outnumbered more than 2 to 1. This was because the valiant men of these tribes trusted in Jehovah and looked to him for help. Let us have complete confidence in Jehovah as we carry on our spiritual warfare against formidable odds.​—Ephesians 6:10-17.

## 1 Chronicles 6

```
Descendants of Levi (1-30)
Temple singers (31-47)

Settlements of the Levites (54-81)
```

## 1 Chronicles 7

```
Descendants of Issachar (1-5), of Benjamin (6-12), of Naphtali (13), of Manasseh (14-19), of Ephraim (20-29), and of Asher (30-40)
```

## 1 Chronicles 8

```

Saul’s family line (33-40)
```

## 1 Chronicles 9

```

```

#### 1Ch 9:33​—How does this verse help us to appreciate the importance of music in true worship? (w10 12/15 21 ¶6)

Yes, through his prophets, Jehovah directed his worshippers to praise him with song. Singers from the priestly tribe were even exempted from duties that other Levites were required to perform so that they could devote sufficient time to composition and, most likely, to rehearsal.​—1 Chron. 9:33.

### You Can Fulfill Challenging Assignments With Jehovah’s Help

from [workbook January–February 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-January-30-February-5-2023/You-Can-Fulfill-Challenging-Assignments-With-Jehovahs-Help/)

- The Levite gatekeepers occupied an office of great responsibility (1Ch 9:26, 27; w05 10/1 9 ¶8)
- Phinehas was chief of the tabernacle gatekeepers in the days of Moses (1Ch 9:17-20a)
- Jehovah helped Phinehas to fulfill his assignment (1Ch 9:20b; w11 9/15 32 ¶7)

Jehovah gives us plenty of important work. If you are ever unsure about how to carry out an assignment, pray to Jehovah and ask a mature Christian for help.​—Php 2:13.

## 1 Chronicles 10

```
Death of Saul and his sons (1-14)
```

### Strengthen Your Desire to Do God’s Will

from [workbook January–February 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-6-12-2023/Strengthen-Your-Desire-to-Do-Gods-Will/)

- Because Saul was disobedient, Jehovah rejected him (1Ch 10:13, 14)
- Jehovah chose David to become king in Saul’s place (1Ch 11:3)
- Unlike Saul, David let himself be guided by Jehovah’s laws and principles (1Ch 11:15-19; w12 11/15 6 ¶12-13)

David loved doing God’s will. (Ps 40:8) We can cultivate a similar desire to do what is right by learning to view things the way Jehovah does.​—Ps 25:4; w18.06 17 ¶5-6.

## 1 Chronicles 11

```
David anointed as king by all Israel (1-3)
David captures Zion (4-9)
David’s mighty warriors (10-47)
```

## 1 Chronicles 12

```
Supporters of David’s kingship (1-40)
```

#### 1Ch 12:33​—What good example did the 50,000 men of Zebulun set? (it-1 1058 ¶5-6)

**Serving With “a Complete Heart.”** The literal heart must be whole to function normally, but the figurative heart can be divided. David prayed: “*Unify my heart* to fear your name,” suggesting that a person’s heart could be divided with regard to its affections and fears. (Ps 86:11) Such a person may be “halfhearted”​—lukewarmly worshiping God. (Ps 119:113; Re 3:16) An individual can also be of “a double heart” (literally, with a heart and a heart), trying to serve two masters, or deceptively saying one thing while thinking something else. (1Ch 12:33; Ps 12:2, ftn) Jesus strongly denounced such doublehearted hypocrisy.​—Mt 15:7, 8.

One seeking to please God must be neither halfhearted nor doublehearted but must serve him with a *complete* heart. (1Ch 28:9) This requires diligent effort in view of the heart’s being desperate and inclined to badness. (Jer 17:9, 10; Ge 8:21) Of help in maintaining a complete heart are: heartfelt prayer (Ps 119:145; La 3:41), regular study of God’s Word (Ezr 7:10; Pr 15:28), zealous participation in preaching the good news (compare Jer 20:9), and association with others whose hearts are complete toward Jehovah.​—Compare 2Ki 10:15, 16.

## 1 Chronicles 13

```
The Ark brought from Kiriath-jearim (1-14)
  Uzzah struck dead (9, 10)
```

### Following Direction Leads to Success

from [workbook January–February 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-13-19-2023/Following-Direction-Leads-to-Success/)

- David wanted to bring the ark of the covenant back to Jerusalem (1Ch 13:3)
- He was unsuccessful when he allowed the ark to be transported improperly (1Ch 15:13; w03 5/1 10-11)
- David succeeded when he searched for Jehovah’s direction (1Ch 15:2; 16:11; w03 5/1 11 ¶13)

Jehovah appreciates our good motives. However, for our actions to be acceptable to Jehovah, we must follow direction.​—De 30:16.

## 1 Chronicles 14

```
David established as king (1, 2)
David’s family (3-7)
Philistines defeated (8-17)
```

## 1 Chronicles 15

```
Levites carry the Ark to Jerusalem (1-29)
  Michal despises David (29)

```

Service before the Ark (37-43)
```

#### 1Ch 16:31​—Why could the Levites sing: “Jehovah has become King!”? (w14 1/15 10 ¶14)

David brought the sacred ark of the covenant to Jerusalem. During this joyous occasion, the Levites sang a song  of praise that contained a noteworthy statement, recorded at 1 Chronicles 16:31: “Declare among the nations: ‘Jehovah has become King!’” One might wonder, ‘Since Jehovah *is* the King of eternity, how is it that he *became* King at that time?’ Jehovah *becomes* King when he expresses his rulership or establishes an agency to represent him at a certain time or to deal with a specific situation. This aspect of Jehovah’s kingship has far-reaching significance. Before David died, Jehovah promised him that his kingship would continue indefinitely: “I will raise up your offspring after you, your own son, and I will firmly establish his kingdom.” (2 Sam. 7:12, 13) In the final outworking of matters, this “offspring” of David appeared more than 1,000 years later. Whom did this prove to be, and when would he become King?

## 1 Chronicles 17

```
David not to build temple (1-6)
Covenant with David for a kingdom (7-15)
David’s prayer of thanksgiving (16-27)
```

#### 1Ch 17:16-18​—Like David, of what can we be confident? (w20.02 12, box)

Have you ever asked yourself, ‘Of all the billions of people alive on earth, why would Jehovah take notice of me?’ If so, you are in good company. King David wrote: “O Jehovah, what is man that you should notice him, the son of mortal man that you should pay attention to him?” (Ps. 144:3) David was confident that Jehovah knew him well. (1 Chron. 17:16-18) And through his Word and his organization, Jehovah reassures you that he notices the love you show for him. Consider some statements in God’s Word that can help you be certain of that fact:

- Jehovah noticed you even before you were born.​—Ps. 139:16.
- Jehovah knows what is in your heart, and he knows what you are thinking.​—1 Chron. 28:9.
- Jehovah personally listens to each one of your prayers.​—Ps. 65:2.
- Your actions affect Jehovah’s feelings.​—Prov. 27:11.
- Jehovah has personally drawn you to him.​—John 6:44.
- If you die, Jehovah knows you so well that he will be able to resurrect you. He will reconstruct your body and restore your mind along with your memories and other unique aspects of your personality.​—John 11:21-26, 39-44; Acts 24:15.

### Maintain Your Joy Despite Disappointments

- David longed to build a beautiful temple for Jehovah (1Ch 17:1, 2; w06 7/15 19 ¶1)
- Jehovah told David that he would not be the one to build the temple (1Ch 17:4)
- David remained absorbed in the work that Jehovah had assigned him (1Ch 17:7; 18:14)

If because of age, health, or other factors you are not eligible for a certain assignment, stay absorbed in the things that you can do.​—Ac 18:5; w21.08 22-23 ¶11.
