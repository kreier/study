from [workbook January–February 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-13-19-2023/Following-Direction-Leads-to-Success/)

- David wanted to bring the ark of the covenant back to Jerusalem (1Ch 13:3)
- He was unsuccessful when he allowed the ark to be transported improperly (1Ch 15:13; w03 5/1 10-11)
- David succeeded when he searched for Jehovah’s direction (1Ch 15:2; 16:11; w03 5/1 11 ¶13)

Jehovah appreciates our good motives. However, for our actions to be acceptable to Jehovah, we must follow direction.​—De 30:16.
