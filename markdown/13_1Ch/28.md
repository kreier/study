### A Father’s Loving Admonition to His Son

from [workbook March–April 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-13-19-2023/A-Fathers-Loving-Admonition-to-His-Son/)

- Get to know Jehovah for yourself (1Ch 28:9; w05 2/15 19 ¶9)
- Serve Jehovah with a complete heart (1Ch 28:9; w12 4/15 16 ¶13)
- Rely on Jehovah, and do not be afraid (1Ch 28:20; w17.09 32 ¶20-21)

Aged King David gave this admonition before his young and inexperienced son Solomon began the important task of building the temple. Why is this advice valuable for all, but especially for young Christians?
