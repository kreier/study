#### 1Ch 16:31​—Why could the Levites sing: “Jehovah has become King!”? (w14 1/15 10 ¶14)

David brought the sacred ark of the covenant to Jerusalem. During this joyous occasion, the Levites sang a song  of praise that contained a noteworthy statement, recorded at 1 Chronicles 16:31: “Declare among the nations: ‘Jehovah has become King!’” One might wonder, ‘Since Jehovah *is* the King of eternity, how is it that he *became* King at that time?’ Jehovah *becomes* King when he expresses his rulership or establishes an agency to represent him at a certain time or to deal with a specific situation. This aspect of Jehovah’s kingship has far-reaching significance. Before David died, Jehovah promised him that his kingship would continue indefinitely: “I will raise up your offspring after you, your own son, and I will firmly establish his kingdom.” (2 Sam. 7:12, 13) In the final outworking of matters, this “offspring” of David appeared more than 1,000 years later. Whom did this prove to be, and when would he become King?
