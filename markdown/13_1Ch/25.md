#### 1Ch 25:7, 8​—What do these verses indicate about the importance of singing songs of praise to Jehovah? (w22.03 22 ¶10)

***We worship Jehovah when we join in song.*** (Ps. 28:7) The Israelites considered singing to be an important part of their worship. King David assigned 288 Levites to be singers at the temple. (1 Chron. 25:1, 6-8) Today, we can express our love for God when we sing songs of praise. The quality of our voice is not the most important thing. Consider this comparison: When we speak, “we all stumble many times,” but that does not prevent us from speaking in the congregation and in the ministry. (Jas. 3:2) Similarly, we should not allow concerns about the imperfections of our singing voice to prevent us from singing praises to Jehovah.
