### The Bible—A Book of Fact, Not Fiction

from [workbook January–February 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-January-16-22-2023/The-Bible-A-Book-of-Fact-Not-Fiction/)

- Adam was a real person (1Ch 1:1; w09 9/1 14 ¶1)
- Noah was also a real person (1Ch 1:4; w08 6/1 3 ¶4)

When we understand that people in the Bible are, not mythical characters, but real people, we better appreciate the lessons we learn from their example.​—1Co 15:22; w09 9/1 14-15.
