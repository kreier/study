## Exodus 40

```
Setting up the tabernacle (1-33)
Jehovah’s glory fills the tabernacle (34-38)
```

#### Ex 40:34​—When the cloud began to cover the tent of meeting, what did this indicate? (w15 7/15 21 ¶1)

When the tabernacle was completed, a cloud “began to cover the tent of meeting, and Jehovah’s glory filled the tabernacle.” (Ex. 40:34) What a clear indication of Jehovah’s approval! How do you think Bezalel and Oholiab felt at that moment? Although their names were not engraved on their handiwork, they must have felt satisfaction in knowing that God’s blessing was on all their efforts. (Prov. 10:22) In the years that followed, it surely warmed their hearts to see that their handiwork continued to be used in Jehovah’s service. When they come back to life in the new world, Bezalel and Oholiab will no doubt be thrilled to learn that the tabernacle was used in true worship for some 500 years!
