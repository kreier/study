## Exodus 2

```
Birth of Moses (1-4)
Pharaoh’s daughter adopts Moses (5-10)
Moses flees to Midian and marries Zipporah (11-22)
God hears Israelites’ groaning (23-25)
```

#### Ex 2:10​—Why is it reasonable to believe that Pharaoh’s daughter adopted Moses? (g04 4/8 6 ¶5)

Is it not farfetched, though, to believe that an Egyptian princess would take in such a child? No, for Egyptian religion taught that kind deeds were a requisite for entrance into heaven. As for the adoption itself, archaeologist Joyce Tyldesley observes: “Egyptian women achieved parity with Egyptian men. They enjoyed the same legal and economic rights, at least in theory, and . . . women could make adoptions.” The ancient Adoption Papyrus actually documents one Egyptian woman’s adoption of her slaves. As for the hiring of Moses’ mother as a wet nurse, The Anchor Bible Dictionary says: “The payment of Moses’ natural mother to nurse him . . . echoes identical arrangements in Mesopotamian adoption contracts.”
