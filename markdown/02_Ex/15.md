## Exodus 15

```
Moses and Israelâ€™s victory song (1-19)
Miriam sings in response (20, 21)
Bitter water made sweet (22-27)
```

### Praise Jehovah in Song

**15:1, 2, 11, 18, 20, 21** from [workbook August 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/august-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-10-16-2020/Praise-Jehovah-in-Song/)

Music can have a powerful influence on the mind and body. Singing is an important part of our worship of Jehovah.

- Moses and the Israelites sang praises to Jehovah for their miraculous deliverance at the Red Sea
- King David assigned 4,000 men to serve as musicians and singers at the temple
- The night before Jesus died, he and his faithful apostles sang praises to Jehovah

What are some opportunities for me to sing praises to Jehovah?
