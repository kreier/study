## Exodus 33

```
God’s message of reproof (1-6)
Tent of meeting outside the camp (7-11)
Moses asks to see Jehovah’s glory (12-23)
```

#### Ex 33:11, 20​—How did God speak to Moses “face-to-face”? (w04 3/15 27 ¶5)

This expression denotes intimate two-way conversation. Moses talked with God’s representative and orally received instruction from Jehovah through him. But Moses did not see Jehovah, since ‘no man can see God and yet live.’ In fact, Jehovah did not personally speak to Moses. The Law “was transmitted through angels by the hand of a mediator,” states Galatians 3:19.
