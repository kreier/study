#### Ex 30:31-33​—Why was it a capital offense to make holy anointing oil and to put it on an unauthorized person? (it-1 114 ¶1)

In the Law Jehovah gave to Moses, he prescribed a formula for the anointing oil. It was of a special composition of the choicest ingredients​—myrrh, sweet cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil. (Ex 30:22-25) It was a capital offense for anyone to compound this mixture and to use it for any common or unauthorized purpose. (Ex 30:31-33) This figuratively demonstrated the importance and sacredness of an appointment to office that had been confirmed by anointing with sacred oil.

### A Contribution to Jehovah

**30:11-16** from [workbook September 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-28-October-4-2020/A-Contribution-to-Jehovah/)

When the tabernacle was constructed, individuals had the privilege of contributing financially to support Jehovah’s worship, regardless of whether they were rich or poor. How can we make a contribution to Jehovah today? One way is by financially supporting Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls, remote translation offices, and Bethel complexes, as well as other buildings that are dedicated to the worship of Jehovah.

What do we learn from the following scriptures about making financial contributions to support true worship?

- 1Ch 29:5
- Mr 12:43, 44
- 1Co 16:2
