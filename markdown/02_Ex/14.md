## Exodus 14

```
Israel reaches the sea (1-4)
Pharaoh pursues Israel (5-14)
Israel crosses the Red Sea (15-25)
Egyptians drown in the sea (26-28)
Israel puts faith in Jehovah (29-31)
```

#### Ex 14:2​—Where was the Red Sea possibly parted to allow Israel to cross over? ([it-1 782 ¶2-3](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/Insight-on-the-Scriptures/Exodus/#p63-p65))

It should be noted that, after reaching the second stage of their journey, Etham “at the edge of the wilderness,” God ordered Moses to “turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth . . . by the sea.” This maneuver would cause Pharaoh to believe the Israelites were “wandering in confusion.” (Ex 13:20; 14:1-3) Scholars favoring the el Haj route as the likely one point out that the Hebrew verb for “turn back” is emphatic and does not mean merely to “divert” or “turn aside,” but has more the sense of returning or at least of a marked detour. They suggest that, upon reaching a point N of the head of the Gulf of Suez, the Israelites reversed their line of march and went around to the E side of Jebel ʽAtaqah, a mountain range bordering the W side of the Gulf. A large host, such as the Israelites were, would find no effective way for swift exit from such a position if pursued from the N, and hence they would be bottled up with the sea blocking their way.

### “Stand Firm and See the Salvation of Jehovah”

**14:13, 14, 21, 22, 26-28** from [workbook August 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/august-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-3-9-2020/Stand-Firm-and-See-the-Salvation-of-Jehovah/)

Jehovah is a caring and considerate Savior. How did he show personal consideration for the Israelites during the Exodus from Egypt?

- He organized them.​—Ex 13:18
- He provided guidance and protection.​—Ex 14:19, 20
- He delivered all of his people, both young and old alike.​—Ex 14:29, 30

What confidence can you have as the great tribulation approaches?​—Isa 30:15
