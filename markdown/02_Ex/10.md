#### Ex 10:1, 2​—What lesson can parents take from these verses? (w95 9/1 11 ¶11)

While the Israelites were still in Egypt, Jehovah sent Moses to Pharaoh and said: “Go in to Pharaoh, because I​—I have let his heart and the hearts of his servants become unresponsive, in order that I may set these signs of mine right before him, and in order that you may declare in the ears of your son and your son’s son how severely I have dealt with Egypt and my signs that I have established among them; and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah.” (Exodus 10:1, 2) Obedient Israelites would tell their children of Jehovah’s mighty acts. Their children, in turn, would tell of them to their children, and so it would be done from generation to generation. Thus, Jehovah’s powerful deeds would be remembered. Likewise today, parents have the responsibility of witnessing to their children.​—Deuteronomy 6:4-7; Proverbs 22:6.

### Moses and Aaron Demonstrate Great Courage

**10:3-6, 24-26, 28; 11:4-8** from workbook July 2020

Moses and Aaron demonstrated great courage and boldness when speaking to Pharaoh, the most powerful man in the world at that time. What enabled them to do it? Regarding Moses, the Bible says: “By faith he left Egypt, but not fearing the anger of the king, for he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.” (Heb 11:27) Moses and Aaron had strong faith in Jehovah and relied on him.
