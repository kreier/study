## Exodus 1

```
Israelites multiply in Egypt (1-7)
Pharaoh oppresses the Israelites (8-14)
God-fearing midwives save lives (15-22)
```

1:15 The names of the midwives were Shiphʹrah and Puʹah. In a culture where women are often not mentioned in genealogical registers, these two are preserved with their names and were blessed for their faithfulness with families (1:21). But the name of the powerful Pharʹaoh is unknown, lost in history.
