### Modest Men Train and Delegate

**18:17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25** from [workbook August 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/august-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-17-23-2020/Modest-Men-Train-and-Delegate/)

Experienced brothers show modesty, love, and foresight when they train younger ones and then delegate responsibility. How?

- Select those who have potential to take on more responsibility
- Clearly communicate what is required to complete a task
- Provide the funds, tools, or help that is needed
- Follow up on progress, and express trust in the student’s ability

ASK YOURSELF, ‘What responsibilities can I entrust to others?’
