## Exodus 20

```
The Ten Commandments (1-17)
Spectacle causes Israel to fear (18-21)
Instructions about worship (22-26)
```

#### Ex 20:4, 5​—How does Jehovah bring “punishment for the error of fathers” upon future generations? (w04 3/15 27 ¶1)

After reaching an age of responsibility, each individual is judged on the basis of his own conduct and attitude. But when the nation of Israel turned to idolatry, it suffered the consequences of this for generations thereafter. Even the faithful Israelites felt its effects in that the nation’s religious delinquency made staying on a course of integrity difficult for them.

### The Ten Commandments and You

**20:3-17** from [workbook August 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/august-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-24-30-2020/The-Ten-Commandments-and-You/)

Christians are not under the Mosaic Law. (Col 2:13, 14) So, then, what purpose do the Ten Commandments and the rest of the Law serve today?

- They reveal Jehovah’s viewpoint on certain matters
- They highlight our responsibilities toward Jehovah
- They define our relationship with our fellowman
