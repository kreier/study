#### Ex 3:1​—What kind of priest was Jethro? (w04 3/15 24 ¶4)

In patriarchal times the family head served as a priest for his family. Jethro was evidently the patriarchal head of a tribe of Midianites. Since the Midianites were Abraham’s descendants by Keturah, they were perhaps exposed to the worship of Jehovah.​—Genesis 25:1, 2.

### “I Will Become What I Choose to Become”

**3:13, 14** from workbook June 2020

Jehovah revealed to Moses a thrilling aspect of His own nature. Within the bounds of his perfect standards, Jehovah becomes whatever is needed in each circumstance to accomplish his will. Much like a human parent, Jehovah fills whatever roles are necessary to care for his children.

What roles has Jehovah filled in my life?
