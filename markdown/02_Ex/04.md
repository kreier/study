#### Ex 4:24-26​—For what possible reason did Zipporah call Jehovah “a bridegroom of blood”? (w04 3/15 28 ¶4)

Zipporah’s expression “you are a bridegroom of blood to me” is an unusual one. What does it indicate about her? By her compliance with the requirements of the circumcision covenant, Zipporah acknowledged a covenant relationship with Jehovah. The Law covenant later made with the Israelites showed that in a covenant relationship, Jehovah can be thought of as a husband and the other party as a wife. (Jeremiah 31:32) Hence, in addressing Jehovah (through his representative angel) as “a bridegroom of blood,” Zipporah appears to have been acknowledging her own submission to the terms of that covenant. It was as if she had accepted a wifely position in the circumcision covenant, with Jehovah God as the husband. In any case, because of her decisive act of obedience to God’s requirement, the life of her son was no longer in danger.

### “I Will Be With You as You Speak”

**4:10-15** from workbook June 2020

With Jehovah’s help, Moses overcame his fears. What can we learn from Jehovah’s interaction with Moses?
- We should avoid focusing on our own inadequacies
- We can be confident that Jehovah will give us whatever we need to fulfill our assignments
- Faith in God is the antidote to fear of man
