#### Ex 29:10​—What is the significance of the expression “lay their hands on the bull’s head”? (it-1 1029 ¶4)

**Laying On of Hands.** Aside from mere handling, *hands were laid on* a person or object for various purposes. The general meaning of the act, however, was that of a designation, a pointing out of the person or thing as being acknowledged, or recognized, in a certain way. During the ceremony at the installation of the priesthood, Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull and the two rams to be sacrificed, thereby acknowledging that these animals were being sacrificed for them for the sake of their becoming priests of Jehovah God. (Ex 29:10, 15, 19; Le 8:14, 18, 22) When appointing Joshua as his successor at God’s command, Moses laid his hand on Joshua, who consequently was “full of the spirit of wisdom” and so was able to lead Israel properly. (De 34:9) Hands were laid on persons when designating them as receivers of a blessing. (Ge 48:14; Mr 10:16) Jesus Christ touched, or laid his hands on, some persons he healed. (Mt 8:3; Mr 6:5; Lu 13:13) The gift of the holy spirit was granted in some instances through the laying on of the hands of the apostles.​—Ac 8:14-20; 19:6.
