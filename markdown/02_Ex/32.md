## Exodus 32

```
Worship of the golden calf (1-35)
  Moses hears strange singing (17, 18)
  Moses smashes the law tablets (19)
  Levites loyal to Jehovah (26-29)
```

32:1-8, 25-35​—Why was Aaron not punished for making the golden calf? Aaron was not in heartfelt sympathy with the idolatry. Later, he apparently joined fellow Levites in taking a stand for God and against those who resisted Moses. After the guilty were slain, Moses reminded the people that they had sinned greatly, indicating that others besides Aaron also received Jehovah’s mercy.
