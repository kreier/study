# Exodus

Written by Moses in the wildernis. The writing was completed 1512 B.C.E. The time covered is from 1657 to 1512 B.C.E.

## Exodus 1

```
Israelites multiply in Egypt (1-7)
Pharaoh oppresses the Israelites (8-14)
God-fearing midwives save lives (15-22)
```

**1:15** The names of the midwives were Shiphʹrah and Puʹah. In a culture where women are often not mentioned in genealogical registers, these two are preserved with their names and were blessed for their faithfulness with families (1:21). But the name of the powerful Pharʹaoh is unknown, lost in history.

## Exodus 2

```
Birth of Moses (1-4)
Pharaoh’s daughter adopts Moses (5-10)
Moses flees to Midian and marries Zipporah (11-22)
God hears Israelites’ groaning (23-25)
```

#### Ex 2:10​—Why is it reasonable to believe that Pharaoh’s daughter adopted Moses? (g04 4/8 6 ¶5)

Is it not farfetched, though, to believe that an Egyptian princess would take in such a child? No, for Egyptian religion taught that kind deeds were a requisite for entrance into heaven. As for the adoption itself, archaeologist Joyce Tyldesley observes: “Egyptian women achieved parity with Egyptian men. They enjoyed the same legal and economic rights, at least in theory, and . . . women could make adoptions.” The ancient Adoption Papyrus actually documents one Egyptian woman’s adoption of her slaves. As for the hiring of Moses’ mother as a wet nurse, The Anchor Bible Dictionary says: “The payment of Moses’ natural mother to nurse him . . . echoes identical arrangements in Mesopotamian adoption contracts.”

## Exodus 3

```
Moses and the burning thornbush (1-12)
Jehovah explains His name (13-15)
Jehovah instructs Moses (16-22)
```

#### Ex 3:1​—What kind of priest was Jethro? (w04 3/15 24 ¶4)

In patriarchal times the family head served as a priest for his family. Jethro was evidently the patriarchal head of a tribe of Midianites. Since the Midianites were Abraham’s descendants by Keturah, they were perhaps exposed to the worship of Jehovah.​—Genesis 25:1, 2.

### “I Will Become What I Choose to Become”

**3:13, 14** from workbook June 2020

Jehovah revealed to Moses a thrilling aspect of His own nature. Within the bounds of his perfect standards, Jehovah becomes whatever is needed in each circumstance to accomplish his will. Much like a human parent, Jehovah fills whatever roles are necessary to care for his children.

What roles has Jehovah filled in my life?

## Exodus 4

```
Three signs for Moses to perform (1-9)
Moses feels inadequate (10-17)
Moses returns to Egypt (18-26)
Moses reunites with Aaron (27-31)
```

#### Ex 4:24-26​—For what possible reason did Zipporah call Jehovah “a bridegroom of blood”? (w04 3/15 28 ¶4)

Zipporah’s expression “you are a bridegroom of blood to me” is an unusual one. What does it indicate about her? By her compliance with the requirements of the circumcision covenant, Zipporah acknowledged a covenant relationship with Jehovah. The Law covenant later made with the Israelites showed that in a covenant relationship, Jehovah can be thought of as a husband and the other party as a wife. (Jeremiah 31:32) Hence, in addressing Jehovah (through his representative angel) as “a bridegroom of blood,” Zipporah appears to have been acknowledging her own submission to the terms of that covenant. It was as if she had accepted a wifely position in the circumcision covenant, with Jehovah God as the husband. In any case, because of her decisive act of obedience to God’s requirement, the life of her son was no longer in danger.

### “I Will Be With You as You Speak”

**4:10-15** from workbook June 2020

With Jehovah’s help, Moses overcame his fears. What can we learn from Jehovah’s interaction with Moses?
- We should avoid focusing on our own inadequacies
- We can be confident that Jehovah will give us whatever we need to fulfill our assignments
- Faith in God is the antidote to fear of man

## Exodus 5

```
Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh (1-5)
Oppression grows (6-18)
Israel blames Moses and Aaron (19-23)
```

#### Ex 5:2​—In what sense did Pharaoh not know Jehovah? (it-2 12 ¶5)

To “know,” therefore, does not necessarily mean merely to be acquainted with or cognizant of something or someone. The foolish Nabal knew David’s name but still asked, “Who is David?” in the sense of asking, “What does he amount to?” (1Sa 25:9-11; compare 2Sa 8:13.) So, too, Pharaoh had said to Moses: “Who is Jehovah, so that I should obey his voice to send Israel away? I do not know Jehovah at all and, what is more, I am not going to send Israel away.” (Ex 5:1, 2) By that, Pharaoh evidently meant that he did not know Jehovah as the true God or as having any authority over Egypt’s king and his affairs, nor as having any might to enforce His will as announced by Moses and Aaron. But now Pharaoh and all Egypt, along with the Israelites, would come to know the real meaning of that name, the person it represented. As Jehovah showed Moses, this would result from God’s carrying out His purpose toward Israel, liberating them, giving them the Promised Land, and thereby fulfilling His covenant with their forefathers. In this way, as God said, “You will certainly know that I am Jehovah your God.”​—Ex 6:4-8; see ALMIGHTY.

## Exodus 6

```
Promise of freedom renewed (1-13)
  Jehovah’s name not fully known (2, 3)
Genealogy of Moses and Aaron (14-27)
Moses again to appear before Pharaoh (28-30)
```

#### Ex 6:3​—In what sense did Jehovah not make his name known to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? (it-1 78 ¶3-4)

Jehovah used the title “God Almighty” (*ʼEl Shad·daiʹ*) when making his promise to Abraham concerning the birth of Isaac, a promise requiring that Abraham have great faith in God’s power to carry out that promise. It was thereafter used when God was spoken of as the one who would bless Isaac and Jacob as heirs of the Abrahamic covenant.​—Ge 17:1; 28:3; 35:11; 48:3.

In harmony with this, Jehovah could later say to Moses: “I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as God Almighty [*beʼElʹ Shad·daiʹ*], but as respects my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them.” (Ex 6:3) This could not mean that the name Jehovah was unknown to these patriarchs, since it was frequently used by them as well as by others before them. (Ge 4:1, 26; 14:22; 27:27; 28:16) In fact, in the book of Genesis, which relates the lives of the patriarchs, the word “Almighty” occurs only 6 times, whereas the personal name Jehovah was written 172 times in the original Hebrew text. Yet, while these patriarchs had come to appreciate by personal experience God’s right to and qualifications for the title of “the Almighty One,” they had not had opportunity to appreciate the full meaning and implications of his personal name, Jehovah. In this regard, *The Illustrated Bible Dictionary* (Vol. 1, p. 572) comments: “The former revelation, to the Patriarchs, concerned promises belonging to a distant future; it supposed that they should be assured that He, Yahweh, was such a God (*ʼel*) as was competent (one possible meaning of *sadday*) to fulfill them. The revelation at the bush was greater and more intimate, God’s power and immediate and continuing presence with them being all wrapped up in the familiar name of Yahweh.”​—Edited by J. D. Douglas, 1980.

### “Now You Will See What I Will Do to Pharaoh”

**6:1, 6, 7; 7:4, 5** from workbook July 2020

Before bringing the plagues on Egypt and delivering the Israelites from slavery, Jehovah told the Israelites what he was about to do. They would see Jehovah’s power demonstrated in ways that they had not previously witnessed, and the Egyptians would certainly know who Jehovah is. When God’s promises came true, the faith of the Israelites was strengthened, and this helped to counteract the false religious influences they had been exposed to in Egypt.

## Exodus 7

```
Jehovah strengthens Moses (1-7)
Aaron’s rod becomes a big snake (8-13)
Plague 1: water turned into blood (14-25)
```

#### Ex 7:1​—How was Moses “like God” to Pharaoh, and how did Aaron become Moses’ “prophet”? (it-2 435 ¶5)

***Moses not disqualified because of diffidence.*** But Moses showed diffidence, arguing that he was unable to speak fluently. Here was a changed Moses, quite different from the one who had, of his own accord, offered himself as Israel’s deliverer 40 years earlier. He continued to remonstrate with Jehovah, finally asking Jehovah to excuse him from the task. Although this aroused God’s anger, he did not reject Moses but provided Moses’ brother Aaron as a mouthpiece. Thus, as Moses was representative for God, so Moses became as “God” to Aaron, who spoke representatively for him. In the ensuing meeting with the older men of Israel and the encounters with Pharaoh, it appears that God gave Moses the instructions and commands and Moses, in turn, relayed them to Aaron, so that Aaron did the actual speaking before Pharaoh (a successor of the Pharaoh from whom Moses had fled 40 years previously). (Ex 2:23; 4:10-17) Later, Jehovah spoke of Aaron as Moses’ “prophet,” meaning that, as Moses was God’s prophet, directed by him, so Aaron should be directed by Moses. Also, Moses was told that he was being made “God to Pharaoh,” that is, given divine power and authority over Pharaoh, so that there was now no need to be afraid of the king of Egypt.​—Ex 7:1, 2.

## Exodus 8

```
Plague 2: frogs (1-15)
Plague 3: gnats (16-19)
Plague 4: gadflies (20-32)
  Goshen not affected (22, 23)
```

#### Ex 8:21​—What was the gadfly? (it-1 878)

[Heb., *ʽa·rovʹ*].

There is some uncertainty as to the particular insect designated by the original Hebrew word appearing in the Scriptures with reference to the fourth plague upon Egypt, the first from which the Israelites in Goshen were spared. (Ex 8:21, 22, 24, 29, 31; Ps 78:45; 105:31) ʽ*A·rov*ʹ has been variously rendered “gadfly” (*JB, NW, Ro*), “beetle” (*Yg*), “flies” (*AS, KJ, RS*), “gnats” (*AT*), and “dog fly” (*LXX*).

The English designation “gadfly” includes the various kinds of horseflies and botflies. Female horseflies pierce the skin of animals as well as man and then suck their blood. In the larval stage botflies live as parasites in the bodies of animals and man; those that infest humans are found in the tropics. A plague of gadflies would, therefore, have brought great suffering to the Egyptians and their livestock and, in certain cases, even death.

#### Ex 8:25-27​—Why did Moses say that Israel’s sacrifices would be “detestable to the Egyptians”? (w04 3/15 25 ¶9)

Many different animals were venerated in Egypt. The mention of sacrifices thus added force and persuasiveness to Moses’ insistence that Israel be allowed to go away to sacrifice to Jehovah.

### Proud Pharaoh Unwittingly Serves God’s Purpose

**8:15, 18, 19; 9:15-17** from workbook July 2020

Egyptian pharaohs viewed themselves as gods. This helps us understand why Pharaoh was too proud to listen to Moses and Aaron and even to his own magic-practicing priests.

Do you listen when others make suggestions? Do you appreciate it when someone counsels you? Or do you feel that you are always right? “Pride is before a crash.” (Pr 16:18) How important it is to guard against pride!

## Exodus 9

```
Plague 5: death of livestock (1-7)
Plague 6: boils on man and beast (8-12)
Plague 7: hail (13-35)
  Pharaoh to see God’s power (16)
  Jehovah’s name to be declared (16)
```

## Exodus 10

```
Plague 8: locusts (1-20)
Plague 9: darkness (21-29)
```

#### Ex 10:1, 2​—What lesson can parents take from these verses? (w95 9/1 11 ¶11)

While the Israelites were still in Egypt, Jehovah sent Moses to Pharaoh and said: “Go in to Pharaoh, because I​—I have let his heart and the hearts of his servants become unresponsive, in order that I may set these signs of mine right before him, and in order that you may declare in the ears of your son and your son’s son how severely I have dealt with Egypt and my signs that I have established among them; and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah.” (Exodus 10:1, 2) Obedient Israelites would tell their children of Jehovah’s mighty acts. Their children, in turn, would tell of them to their children, and so it would be done from generation to generation. Thus, Jehovah’s powerful deeds would be remembered. Likewise today, parents have the responsibility of witnessing to their children.​—Deuteronomy 6:4-7; Proverbs 22:6.

### Moses and Aaron Demonstrate Great Courage

**10:3-6, 24-26, 28; 11:4-8** from workbook July 2020

Moses and Aaron demonstrated great courage and boldness when speaking to Pharaoh, the most powerful man in the world at that time. What enabled them to do it? Regarding Moses, the Bible says: “By faith he left Egypt, but not fearing the anger of the king, for he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.” (Heb 11:27) Moses and Aaron had strong faith in Jehovah and relied on him.

## Exodus 11

```
Tenth plague announced (1-10)
  Israelites to ask for gifts (2)
```

#### Ex 11:7​—What did Jehovah mean when he said that “not even a dog will bark at the Israelites”? (it-1 783 ¶5)

So by a spectacular display of power Jehovah exalted his name and delivered Israel. Safe on the E shore of the Red Sea, Moses led the sons of Israel in a song, while his sister Miriam, the prophetess, took a tambourine in her hand and led all the women with tambourines and in dances, responding in song to the men. (Ex 15:1, 20, 21) A complete separation of Israel from their foes had been effected. When they went out from Egypt they were not allowed to suffer harm from man or beast; no dog even snarled at the Israelites or moved its tongue against them. (Ex 11:7) While the Exodus narrative does not mention that Pharaoh personally went into the sea with his military forces and was destroyed, Psalm 136:15 does state that Jehovah “shook off Pharaoh and his military force into the Red Sea.”

## Exodus 12

```
Institution of Passover (1-28)
  Blood to be splashed on doorposts (7)
Plague 10: firstborn killed (29-32)
The Exodus begins (33-42)
  End of 430 years (40, 41)
Instructions for Passover participation (43-51)
```

#### Ex 12:12​—How were the plagues on the Egyptians, especially the tenth one, a judgment against their false gods? (it-2 582 ¶2)

The Ten Plagues upon Egypt all proved to be a judgment against the gods of Egypt, especially the tenth, the death of the firstborn. (Ex 12:12) For the ram (male sheep) was sacred to the god Ra, so that splashing the blood of the Passover lamb on the doorways would be blasphemy in the eyes of the Egyptians. Also, the bull was sacred, and the destruction of the firstborn of the bulls would be a blow to the god Osiris. Pharaoh himself was venerated as a son of Ra. The death of Pharaoh’s own firstborn would thus show the impotence of both Ra and Pharaoh.

#### Ex 12:14-16​—The Festival of Unfermented Cakes, as with other holy conventions, had what unique feature, and how did it benefit the Israelites? (it-1 504 ¶1)

A unique feature of all of these “holy conventions” was that during them the people were to do no laborious work. For instance, the first and seventh days of the Festival of Unfermented Cakes were “holy conventions,” concerning which Jehovah stated: “No work is to be done on them. Only what every soul needs to eat, that alone may be done for you.” (Ex 12:15, 16) However, during “holy conventions” the priests were busy offering sacrifices to Jehovah (Le 23:37, 38), certainly no violation of any command against doing normal daily work. These occasions were not periods of idleness for the people in general either but were times of great spiritual benefit. On the weekly Sabbath day, the people met together for public worship and instruction. They were then edified by the public reading and explanation of God’s written Word, as in the later synagogues. (Ac 15:21) Therefore, while the people did not do laborious work during the Sabbath day or the other “holy conventions,” they would then devote themselves to prayer and meditation on the Creator and his purposes.​—See ASSEMBLY.

### The Passover​—Its Significance for Christians

**12:5-7, 12, 13, 24-27** from [workbook July 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-27-August-2-2020/The-Passover-Its-Significance-for-Christians/)

In order for the Israelites to avoid being harmed by the tenth plague, it was vital for them to obey instructions. (Ex 12:28) On the night of Nisan 14, families were to assemble in their own home. They were to kill a sound one-year-old male lamb or goat. Its blood was to be sprinkled on the doorposts and on the upper part of the doorway. Then they were to roast the entire animal and eat it in a hurry. No one was to go out of the house until morning.​—Ex 12:9-11, 22.

## Exodus 13

```
Every firstborn male belongs to Jehovah (1, 2)
Festival of Unleavened Bread (3-10)
Every firstborn male devoted to God (11-16)
Israel directed toward the Red Sea (17-20)
Pillar of cloud and of fire (21, 22)
```

#### Ex 13:17​—How did Jehovah show consideration for the Israelites when leading them out of Egypt? ([it-1 1117](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/Insight-on-the-Scriptures/Highway-Road/#p3))

From ancient times highways and roads, including several important trade routes, linked cities and kingdoms in the area of Palestine. (Nu 20:17-19; 21:21, 22; 22:5, 21-23; Jos 2:22; Jg 21:19; 1Sa 6:9, 12; 13:17, 18; see KING’S ROAD.) What is considered to have been the principal route led from Egypt to the Philistine cities of Gaza and Ashkelon and gradually bent northeastward in the direction of Megiddo. It continued to Hazor, N of the Sea of Galilee, and then led to Damascus. This route via Philistia was the shortest from Egypt to the Promised Land. But Jehovah kindly led the Israelites by another way so that they would not get disheartened by a Philistine attack.​—Ex 13:17.

## Exodus 14

```
Israel reaches the sea (1-4)
Pharaoh pursues Israel (5-14)
Israel crosses the Red Sea (15-25)
Egyptians drown in the sea (26-28)
Israel puts faith in Jehovah (29-31)
```

#### Ex 14:2​—Where was the Red Sea possibly parted to allow Israel to cross over? ([it-1 782 ¶2-3](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/Insight-on-the-Scriptures/Exodus/#p63-p65))

It should be noted that, after reaching the second stage of their journey, Etham “at the edge of the wilderness,” God ordered Moses to “turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth . . . by the sea.” This maneuver would cause Pharaoh to believe the Israelites were “wandering in confusion.” (Ex 13:20; 14:1-3) Scholars favoring the el Haj route as the likely one point out that the Hebrew verb for “turn back” is emphatic and does not mean merely to “divert” or “turn aside,” but has more the sense of returning or at least of a marked detour. They suggest that, upon reaching a point N of the head of the Gulf of Suez, the Israelites reversed their line of march and went around to the E side of Jebel ʽAtaqah, a mountain range bordering the W side of the Gulf. A large host, such as the Israelites were, would find no effective way for swift exit from such a position if pursued from the N, and hence they would be bottled up with the sea blocking their way.

### “Stand Firm and See the Salvation of Jehovah”

**14:13, 14, 21, 22, 26-28** from [workbook August 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/august-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-3-9-2020/Stand-Firm-and-See-the-Salvation-of-Jehovah/)

Jehovah is a caring and considerate Savior. How did he show personal consideration for the Israelites during the Exodus from Egypt?

- He organized them.​—Ex 13:18
- He provided guidance and protection.​—Ex 14:19, 20
- He delivered all of his people, both young and old alike.​—Ex 14:29, 30

What confidence can you have as the great tribulation approaches?​—Isa 30:15


## Exodus 15

```
Moses and Israel’s victory song (1-19)
Miriam sings in response (20, 21)
Bitter water made sweet (22-27)
```

### Praise Jehovah in Song

**15:1, 2, 11, 18, 20, 21** from [workbook August 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/august-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-10-16-2020/Praise-Jehovah-in-Song/)

Music can have a powerful influence on the mind and body. Singing is an important part of our worship of Jehovah.

- Moses and the Israelites sang praises to Jehovah for their miraculous deliverance at the Red Sea
- King David assigned 4,000 men to serve as musicians and singers at the temple
- The night before Jesus died, he and his faithful apostles sang praises to Jehovah

What are some opportunities for me to sing praises to Jehovah?

## Exodus 16

```
People murmur about food (1-3)
Jehovah hears the murmurings (4-12)
Quail and manna provided (13-21)
No manna on the Sabbath (22-30)
Manna kept as a reminder (31-36)
```

#### Ex 16:13​—Why might Jehovah have chosen quail to feed the Israelites in the wilderness? ([w11 9/1 14](https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/wp20110901/Did-You-Know/#p2-p6))

▪ Following the Israelites’ Exodus from Egypt, God twice provided them with an abundance of meat in the form of quail.​—Exodus 16:13; Numbers 11:31.

Quail are small birds, about 7 inches (18 cm) in length and weighing about 3.5 ounces (100 g). They breed in many parts of western Asia and Europe. Being migratory birds, they winter in North Africa and Arabia. During their seasonal passage, vast flocks traverse the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea and fly over the Sinai Peninsula.

According to The New Westminster Dictionary of the Bible, quail “fly rapidly and well, and take advantage of the wind; but if the wind changes its course, or the birds become exhausted from long flight, the whole immense flock is apt to fall to the ground, where the birds lie stunned.” Before continuing their migration, they have to rest on the ground for a day or two, thus becoming easy catch for hunters. In the early 20th century, Egypt was exporting some three million quail annually for food.

Both times that the Israelites fed on quail were in the spring. Although quail regularly flew over the Sinai area during that time, it was Jehovah who caused ‘a wind to burst forth’ to drive these birds into the Israelite encampment.​—Numbers 11:31.

#### Ex 16:32-34​—Where was the jar of manna kept? ([w06 1/15 31](https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/w20060115/Questions-From-Readers/#p5))

Shortly after their deliverance from Egypt, the Israelites began to murmur about food. So Jehovah provided manna for them. (Exodus 12:17, 18; 16:1-5) At that time, Moses instructed Aaron: “Take a jar and put in it an omerful of manna and deposit it before Jehovah as something to be kept throughout your generations.” The account states: “Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, Aaron proceeded to deposit it before the Testimony [an archive for the safekeeping of important documents] as something to be kept.” (Exodus 16:33, 34) While Aaron undoubtedly gathered manna into a jar at that time, the depositing of it before the Testimony had to wait until Moses made the Ark and placed the tablets in it.

## Exodus 17

```
Complaint about lack of water at Horeb (1-4)
Water from a rock (5-7)
Amalekites’ attack and defeat (8-16)
```

#### Ex 17:11-13​—How can we imitate the decisive action of Aaron and Hur? (w16.09 6 ¶14)

Aaron and Hur literally supported Moses’ hands during a battle. As for us, we can look for ways to support and to give practical aid to others. To whom? To those battling the effects of old age, health limitations, opposition from their family, loneliness, or the loss of a loved one. We can also strengthen young ones who are facing pressure to share in wrongdoing or to seek “success” in this system of things, whether academically, financially, or professionally. (1 Thess. 3:1-3; 5:11, 14) Look for ways to show genuine interest in others at the Kingdom Hall, in the ministry, while enjoying a meal together, or as you converse on the telephone.

#### Ex 17:14​—Why are Moses’ writings part of the Bible canon? ([it-1 406](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/Insight-on-the-Scriptures/Canon/#p6))

That these writings of Moses were of divine origin, inspired of God, canonical, and a safe guideline for pure worship, there can be no doubt, in the light of internal evidence. It was not through Moses’ initiative that he became the leader and commander of the Israelites; at first Moses drew back at the suggestion. (Ex 3:10, 11; 4:10-14) Rather, God raised Moses up and invested in him such miraculous powers that even Pharaoh’s magic-practicing priests were compelled to acknowledge that what Moses did originated with God. (Ex 4:1-9; 8:16-19) So it was not Moses’ personal ambition to be an orator and writer. Rather, in obedience to God’s command and with the divine credentials of holy spirit, Moses was moved first to speak and then to write down part of the Bible canon.​—Ex 17:14.

## Exodus 18

```
Jethro and Zipporah arrive (1-12)
Jethro’s advice to appoint judges (13-27)
```

### Modest Men Train and Delegate

**18:17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25** from [workbook August 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/august-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-17-23-2020/Modest-Men-Train-and-Delegate/)

Experienced brothers show modesty, love, and foresight when they train younger ones and then delegate responsibility. How?

- Select those who have potential to take on more responsibility
- Clearly communicate what is required to complete a task
- Provide the funds, tools, or help that is needed
- Follow up on progress, and express trust in the student’s ability

ASK YOURSELF, ‘What responsibilities can I entrust to others?’
