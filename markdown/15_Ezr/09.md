## Ezra 9

```
Intermarriage in Israel (1-4)
Ezra’s prayer of confession (5-15)
```

#### Ezr 9:1, 2—How serious a threat was intermarriage with “the peoples of the lands”? (w06 1/15 20 ¶1)

The restored nation was to be the guardian of Jehovah’s worship until the coming of the Messiah. Intermarriage with other inhabitants was a real threat to true worship. Because some had formed marriage alliances with the idol-worshipping people, the entire nation might eventually be assimilated into the pagan nations. Pure worship could have vanished from the face of the earth. To whom, then, would the Messiah come? No wonder Ezra was stunned at seeing what had taken place!

### The Painful Consequences of Disobedience

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-17-23-2023/The-Painful-Consequences-of-Disobedience/)

- Some Israelites formed marriage alliances with idol-worshipping people (Ezr 9:1, 2; w06 1/15 20 ¶1)
- They disregarded Jehovah’s clear commands (Ezr 9:10-12)
- Their disobedience resulted in much pain to themselves and their families (Ezr 10:10, 11, 44)

Every commandment of Jehovah is for our good. (w09 10/1 10 ¶6) Obedience will spare us many frustrations now and lead to endless future blessings.
