## Ezra 5

```
The Jews resume temple building (1-5)
Tattenai’s letter to King Darius (6-17)
```

#### 5:5—Why did the opposers not stop the building work? (w86 1/15 9 ¶2) 

Jehovah’s watchcare was upon his faithful servants. (2 Chronicles 16:9) Strengthened by God’s spirit, the elders refused to be intimidated. They referred to the long-forgotten decree of Cyrus. Since Persian law was unalterable, the adversaries feared opposing a royal decree. (Daniel 6:8, 15) Jehovah’s direction was evident, and the work continued.
