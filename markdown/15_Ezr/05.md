## Ezra 5

```
The Jews resume temple building (1-5)
Tattenai’s letter to King Darius (6-17)
```

#### 5:5—Why did the opposers not stop the building work? (w86 1/15 9 ¶2) 

Jehovah’s watchcare was upon his faithful servants. (2 Chronicles 16:9) Strengthened by God’s spirit, the elders refused to be intimidated. They referred to the long-forgotten decree of Cyrus. Since Persian law was unalterable, the adversaries feared opposing a royal decree. (Daniel 6:8, 15) Jehovah’s direction was evident, and the work continued.

### “Do Not Interfere With the Work”

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-3-9-2023/Do-Not-Interfere-With-the-Work/)

- High Priest Jeshua (Joshua) and Governor Zerubbabel took the lead in rebuilding the temple despite a ban (Ezr 5:1, 2; w22.03 18 ¶13)
- When opposers asked who authorized the work, the Jews referred to Cyrus’ decree (Ezr 5:3, 17; w86 2/1 29, box ¶2-3)
- The king confirmed the earlier decree and ordered opposers to stop interfering with the work (Ezr 6:7, 8; w22.03 15 ¶7)

**FOR MEDITATION:** How does this Bible account help us to follow direction that we may not fully understand from those whom Jehovah has appointed to take the lead?​—w22.03 19 ¶16.
