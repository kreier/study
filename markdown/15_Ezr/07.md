Artaxerxesâ€™ letter to Ezra (11-26)
Ezra praises Jehovah (27, 28)
```

### Jehovah Wants Willing Servants

**7:7, 22; 8:26, 27** from workbook January 2016

Ezra made preparations to return to Jerusalem

- Ezra receives permission from King Artaxerxes to return to Jerusalem to advance worship of Jehovah there
- The king grants Ezra "everything he requested" for Jehovah's house - gold, silver, wheat, wine, oil, and salt, all worth well over $100,000,000 (U.S.) at modern values

**7:13; 8:21-23** Ezra trusted in Jehovah to protect His servants

- The return to Jerusalem would be difficult
- The possible route was nearly 1000 miles (1600 km) through dangerous territory
- The journey took about 4 months
- Those who returned needed strong faith, zeal for true worship, and courage
