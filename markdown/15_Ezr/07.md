### Jehovah Wants Willing Servants

from [workbook January 2016](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-2016-mwb/meeting-schedule-jan25-31/)

**7:7, 22; 8:26, 27** Ezra made preparations to return to Jerusalem

- Ezra receives permission from King Artaxerxes to return to Jerusalem to advance worship of Jehovah there
- The king grants Ezra "everything he requested" for Jehovah's house - gold, silver, wheat, wine, oil, and salt, all worth well over $100,000,000 (U.S.) at modern values

**7:13; 8:21-23** Ezra trusted in Jehovah to protect His servants

- The return to Jerusalem would be difficult
- The possible route was nearly 1000 miles (1600 km) through dangerous territory
- The journey took about 4 months
- Those who returned needed strong faith, zeal for true worship, and courage

**EZRA TRAVELED WITH ...** Gold and silver weighing over 750 talents, or about the weight of 3 full-grown male African elephants!

**CHALLENGES FACED BY RETURNEES ...** Marauder bands, desert terrain, dangerous wildlife

### Ezra’s Conduct Brought Honor to Jehovah

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-10-16-2023/Ezras-Conduct-Brought-Honor-to-Jehovah/)

- Ezra allowed God’s Word to touch his heart and affect his conduct (Ezr 7:10; w00 10/1 14 ¶8)
- Through Ezra, others recognized the wisdom of God (Ezr 7:25; si 75 ¶5)
- Because he humbled himself before God, Ezra was confident that Jehovah would guide and protect him (Ezr 8:21-23; it-1 1158 ¶4)

The godly wisdom demonstrated by Ezra moved the king to entrust him with heavy responsibilities. Like Ezra, we can bring honor to Jehovah by our conduct.
