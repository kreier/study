#### Ezr 8:1​—Why were many Jews in Babylon reluctant to go up to Jerusalem with Ezra? (w06 1/15 19 ¶10)

Even though more than 60 years had passed since the first group of Jews had returned to their homeland, Jerusalem was only sparsely settled. Returning to Jerusalem meant building a new life under uncomfortable and dangerous circumstances. The Jerusalem of the day did not hold out attractive material prospects to the Jews who might have been prospering in  Babylon. Not to be overlooked was the dangerous journey. The returnees had to have strong faith in Jehovah, zeal for true worship, and courage to make the move. Even Ezra strengthened himself according to the hand of Jehovah upon him. With Ezra’s encouragement, 1,500 families​—perhaps numbering 6,000 people—​responded. After Ezra took additional initiatives, 38 Levites and 220 Nethinim responded.
