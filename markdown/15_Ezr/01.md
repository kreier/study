## Ezra 1

```
King Cyrus’ decree to rebuild the temple (1-4)
Preparations for exiles’ return from Babylon (5-11)
```

#### Ezr 1:3-6—Why were the Israelites who did not volunteer to return to Jerusalem not necessarily weak in faith? (w06 1/15 17 ¶5; 19 ¶1)

Some may not have returned to Jerusalem because they were materialistic or lacked appreciation for true worship, but this was not true in every case. First of all, the 1,000-mile **[1,600 km]** journey to Jerusalem took four or five months. Moreover, settling in a land that had remained desolate for 70 years and doing the rebuilding work there would require much physical stamina. Therefore, unfavorable circumstances, such as physical ailments, advanced age, and family obligations, undoubtedly prevented some from returning.

Like some of the Israelites who remained in Babylon, many of Jehovah’s Witnesses cannot take up the full-time ministry or serve where the need is greater. Yet, they support and encourage those who can and make voluntary donations to further the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work.

### Allow Jehovah to Use You

from [workbook May–June 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-26-July-2-2023/Allow-Jehovah-to-Use-You/)

- Jehovah stirred the spirit of King Cyrus to release the Israelites (Ezr 1:1-3; w22.03 14 ¶1)
- Jehovah stirred the spirit of his people to rebuild the temple (Ezr 1:5; w17.10 26 ¶2)

If you make yourself available, Jehovah can cause you to become whatever he needs to accomplish his will.
