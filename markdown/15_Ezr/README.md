# Ezra

Written by Ezra in Jerusalem. The writing was completed c. 460 B.C.E. The time covered is from 537 to c. 467 B.C.E.

## Ezra 1

```
King Cyrus’ decree to rebuild the temple (1-4)
Preparations for exiles’ return from Babylon (5-11)
```

#### Ezr 1:3-6—Why were the Israelites who did not volunteer to return to Jerusalem not necessarily weak in faith? (w06 1/15 17 ¶5; 19 ¶1)

Some may not have returned to Jerusalem because they were materialistic or lacked appreciation for true worship, but this was not true in every case. First of all, the 1,000-mile **[1,600 km]** journey to Jerusalem took four or five months. Moreover, settling in a land that had remained desolate for 70 years and doing the rebuilding work there would require much physical stamina. Therefore, unfavorable circumstances, such as physical ailments, advanced age, and family obligations, undoubtedly prevented some from returning.

Like some of the Israelites who remained in Babylon, many of Jehovah’s Witnesses cannot take up the full-time ministry or serve where the need is greater. Yet, they support and encourage those who can and make voluntary donations to further the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work.

### Allow Jehovah to Use You

from [workbook May–June 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-26-July-2-2023/Allow-Jehovah-to-Use-You/)

- Jehovah stirred the spirit of King Cyrus to release the Israelites (Ezr 1:1-3; w22.03 14 ¶1)
- Jehovah stirred the spirit of his people to rebuild the temple (Ezr 1:5; w17.10 26 ¶2)

If you make yourself available, Jehovah can cause you to become whatever he needs to accomplish his will.

## Ezra 2

```
List of exiles who returned (1-67)
  Temple servants (43-54)
  Sons of the servants of Solomon (55-57)
Voluntary offerings for the temple (68-70)
```

## Ezra 3

```
Altar rebuilt and sacrifices offered (1-6)
The temple rebuilding begins (7-9)
Temple foundation laid (10-13)
```

### Jehovah keeps his promises

from [workbook January 2016](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-2016-mwb/meeting-schedule-jan18-24/gods-promises-jerusalem-temple/)

Jehovah promised a restoration of true worship a thte temple of Jerusalem. But after the exiles return from Babylont, there were numerous obstacles, including a royal decree to halt construction. Many feared that the work would never be completed.

[nice graphic to be included in the future]

- **c. 537 B.C.E.** Cyrus decreed that the temple be rebuilt
- **seventh month** Altar set up; sacrifices offered (3:3)
- **536 B.C.E.** Foundation laid (3:10, 11)
- **Period of extreme opposition** 536 - 522 B.C.E.
- **522 B.C.E.** King Atraxerxes stopped construction (4:23, 24)
- **520 B.C.E.** Zechariah and Haggai encouraged the people to resume construction (5:1, 2)
- **515 B.C.E.** Temple completed (6:15)

## Ezra 4

```
Opposition to rebuilding the temple (1-6)
Enemies send complaint to King Artaxerxes (7-16)
Artaxerxes’ reply (17-22)
Temple construction halted (23, 24)
```

#### Ezr 4:1-3—Why was an offer of help rejected? (w06 1/15 19 ¶3)

The faithful remnant rejected an offer that would have meant forming a religious alliance with false worshippers. (Exodus 20:5; 34:12) Jehovah’s worshippers today similarly take no part in any interfaith movements.

## Ezra 5

```
The Jews resume temple building (1-5)
Tattenai’s letter to King Darius (6-17)
```

#### 5:5—Why did the opposers not stop the building work? (w86 1/15 9 ¶2) 

Jehovah’s watchcare was upon his faithful servants. (2 Chronicles 16:9) Strengthened by God’s spirit, the elders refused to be intimidated. They referred to the long-forgotten decree of Cyrus. Since Persian law was unalterable, the adversaries feared opposing a royal decree. (Daniel 6:8, 15) Jehovah’s direction was evident, and the work continued.

### “Do Not Interfere With the Work”

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-3-9-2023/Do-Not-Interfere-With-the-Work/)

- High Priest Jeshua (Joshua) and Governor Zerubbabel took the lead in rebuilding the temple despite a ban (Ezr 5:1, 2; w22.03 18 ¶13)
- When opposers asked who authorized the work, the Jews referred to Cyrus’ decree (Ezr 5:3, 17; w86 2/1 29, box ¶2-3)
- The king confirmed the earlier decree and ordered opposers to stop interfering with the work (Ezr 6:7, 8; w22.03 15 ¶7)

**FOR MEDITATION:** How does this Bible account help us to follow direction that we may not fully understand from those whom Jehovah has appointed to take the lead?​—w22.03 19 ¶16.

## Ezra 6

```
Darius’ investigation and decree (1-12)
Temple completed and inaugurated (13-18)
Passover observed (19-22)
```

#### Ezr 6:13​—Why is the expression “Beyond the River” significant? (w93 6/15 32 ¶3-5)

This coin (enlarged view) is a good example. What does the writing say?

The coin was made in Tarsus, a city in the southeastern part of what is now Turkey. The coin was produced during the rule of the Persian governor Mazaeus in the fourth century B.C.E. It identifies him as governor of the province “Beyond the River,” that is, the Euphrates River.

But why is that phrase interesting? Because you will find the same designation in your Bible. Ezra 5:6–6:13 sets out correspondence between the Persian king Darius and a governor named Tattenai. At issue was the Jews’ rebuilding of their temple in Jerusalem. Ezra was a skilled copyist of God’s Law, and you would expect him to be precise, accurate in what he wrote. You will see at Ezra 5:6 and 6:13 that he termed Tattenai “the governor beyond the River.”

Ezra penned that about 460 B.C.E., some 100 years before this coin was minted. Oh, some people might feel that the designation for an ancient official is a minor detail. But if you can rely on the Bible writers in even such small details, should that not increase your confidence in what else they wrote?

## Ezra 7

```
Ezra comes to Jerusalem (1-10)
Artaxerxes’ letter to Ezra (11-26)
Ezra praises Jehovah (27, 28)
```

### Jehovah Wants Willing Servants

from [workbook January 2016](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-2016-mwb/meeting-schedule-jan25-31/)

**7:7, 22; 8:26, 27** Ezra made preparations to return to Jerusalem

- Ezra receives permission from King Artaxerxes to return to Jerusalem to advance worship of Jehovah there
- The king grants Ezra "everything he requested" for Jehovah's house - gold, silver, wheat, wine, oil, and salt, all worth well over $100,000,000 (U.S.) at modern values

**7:13; 8:21-23** Ezra trusted in Jehovah to protect His servants

- The return to Jerusalem would be difficult
- The possible route was nearly 1000 miles (1600 km) through dangerous territory
- The journey took about 4 months
- Those who returned needed strong faith, zeal for true worship, and courage

**EZRA TRAVELED WITH ...** Gold and silver weighing over 750 talents, or about the weight of 3 full-grown male African elephants!

**CHALLENGES FACED BY RETURNEES ...** Marauder bands, desert terrain, dangerous wildlife

### Ezra’s Conduct Brought Honor to Jehovah

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-10-16-2023/Ezras-Conduct-Brought-Honor-to-Jehovah/)

- Ezra allowed God’s Word to touch his heart and affect his conduct (Ezr 7:10; w00 10/1 14 ¶8)
- Through Ezra, others recognized the wisdom of God (Ezr 7:25; si 75 ¶5)
- Because he humbled himself before God, Ezra was confident that Jehovah would guide and protect him (Ezr 8:21-23; it-1 1158 ¶4)

The godly wisdom demonstrated by Ezra moved the king to entrust him with heavy responsibilities. Like Ezra, we can bring honor to Jehovah by our conduct.

## Ezra 8

```
List of those returning with Ezra (1-14)
Preparations for the journey (15-30)
Departure from Babylon and arrival in Jerusalem (31-36)
```

#### Ezr 8:1​—Why were many Jews in Babylon reluctant to go up to Jerusalem with Ezra? (w06 1/15 19 ¶10)

Even though more than 60 years had passed since the first group of Jews had returned to their homeland, Jerusalem was only sparsely settled. Returning to Jerusalem meant building a new life under uncomfortable and dangerous circumstances. The Jerusalem of the day did not hold out attractive material prospects to the Jews who might have been prospering in  Babylon. Not to be overlooked was the dangerous journey. The returnees had to have strong faith in Jehovah, zeal for true worship, and courage to make the move. Even Ezra strengthened himself according to the hand of Jehovah upon him. With Ezra’s encouragement, 1,500 families​—perhaps numbering 6,000 people—​responded. After Ezra took additional initiatives, 38 Levites and 220 Nethinim responded.

## Ezra 9

```
Intermarriage in Israel (1-4)
Ezra’s prayer of confession (5-15)
```

#### Ezr 9:1, 2—How serious a threat was intermarriage with “the peoples of the lands”? (w06 1/15 20 ¶1)

The restored nation was to be the guardian of Jehovah’s worship until the coming of the Messiah. Intermarriage with other inhabitants was a real threat to true worship. Because some had formed marriage alliances with the idol-worshipping people, the entire nation might eventually be assimilated into the pagan nations. Pure worship could have vanished from the face of the earth. To whom, then, would the Messiah come? No wonder Ezra was stunned at seeing what had taken place!

### The Painful Consequences of Disobedience

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-17-23-2023/The-Painful-Consequences-of-Disobedience/)

- Some Israelites formed marriage alliances with idol-worshipping people (Ezr 9:1, 2; w06 1/15 20 ¶1)
- They disregarded Jehovah’s clear commands (Ezr 9:10-12)
- Their disobedience resulted in much pain to themselves and their families (Ezr 10:10, 11, 44)

Every commandment of Jehovah is for our good. (w09 10/1 10 ¶6) Obedience will spare us many frustrations now and lead to endless future blessings.

## Ezra 10

```
Covenant to send away foreign wives (1-14)
Foreign wives dismissed (15-44)
```

#### Ezr 10:3—Why were the children sent away along with the wives? (w06 1/15 20 ¶2)

If the children had stayed behind, the likelihood that the dismissed wives would return on account of them would have increased. Moreover, little children generally require the care of their mother.
