## Leviticus 3

```
The communion offering (1-17)
  Do not eat fat or blood (17)
```

#### Le 3:17​—Why were the Israelites prohibited from eating fat, and what lesson does this teach? (it-1 813; w04 5/15 22 ¶2)

Since the fat was regarded as the best or the richest part, the prohibition against eating it evidently impressed upon the Israelites that the best part belonged to Jehovah. (Genesis 45:18) This reminds us that we should give our very best to Jehovah.​—Proverbs 3:9, 10; Colossians 3:23, 24.
