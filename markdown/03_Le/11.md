## Leviticus 11

```
Clean and unclean animals (1-47)
```

#### Le 11:8​—Must Christians refuse to eat animals prohibited under the Mosaic Law? (it-1 111 ¶5)

These dietary limitations applied only to those who were under the Mosaic Law, for the statement of Leviticus 11:8 is: “They are unclean for you,” that is, for the Israelites. With the abrogation of the Law on the basis of the sacrificial death of Christ Jesus, the prohibitions were canceled, and once more all humans could consider themselves under the same broad provision announced to Noah following the Deluge.​—Col 2:13-17; Ge 9:3, 4.
