## Leviticus 2

```
The grain offering (1-16)
```

#### Le 2:13​—Why did salt have to be presented with every offering? (Eze 43:24; w04 5/15 22 ¶1)

This was not done to enhance the flavor of the sacrifices. Around the world, salt is used as a preservative. It was likely presented with offerings because it represents freedom from corruption and decay.
