### Jehovah Sets His People Apart

from [workbook January-February 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-January-11-17-2021/Jehovah-Sets-His-People-Apart/)

- We must obey all of Jehovah’s laws (Le 20:22, 23; w04 10/15 11 ¶12)
- Jehovah promises an inheritance (Le 20:24; it-1 1199)
- Jehovah expects clean worship from his people (Le 20:25, 26; it-1 317 ¶2)

Jehovah blesses those who maintain a good relationship with him. To preserve his favor, we must remain separate from the world around us and its unclean practices.
