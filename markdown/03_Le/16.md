## Leviticus 16

```
The Day of Atonement (1-34)
```

#### Le 16:10​—In what ways did the goat for Azazel picture the sacrifice of Jesus? (it-1 226 ¶3)

As the apostle Paul explained, by Jesus’ offering of his own perfect human life as a sacrifice for the sins of mankind, he accomplished far more than had been achieved by “the blood of bulls and of goats.” (Heb 10:4, 11, 12) He thus served as “the scapegoat,” being the ‘carrier of our sicknesses,’ the one “pierced for our transgression.” (Isa 53:4, 5; Mt 8:17; 1Pe 2:24) He ‘carried away’ the sins of all who exercise faith in the value of his sacrifice. He demonstrated the provision of God to take sinfulness into complete oblivion. In these ways the goat “for Azazel” pictures the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

### Atonement Day and You

**16:12-15** from [workbook December 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/december-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-28-2020-January-3-2021/Atonement-Day-and-You/)

What can we learn from the use of incense on Atonement Day?

- The acceptable prayers of Jehovah’s faithful servants are like incense. (Ps 141:2) Just as the high priest brought the incense to Jehovah with great respect, we approach Jehovah in prayer with awe and respect
- The high priest had to burn incense before he could offer up the sacrifices. Similarly, before Jesus could offer up his life as a sacrifice, he had to prepare the way for Jehovah to accept his sacrifice by living a life of integrity and loyalty
