### An Expression of Thanksgiving

**7:11-15, 20** from [workbook November 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-23-29-2020/An-Expression-of-Thanksgiving/)

Communion sacrifices in Israel remind us of the importance of expressing our appreciation to Jehovah in our prayers and by our conduct.​—Php 4:6, 7; Col 3:15.

- When we pray, what specific things can we thank Jehovah for?​—1Th 5:17, 18
- How does showing thankfulness benefit us?
- How might someone partake of “the table of demons,” and how would this show a lack of appreciation to Jehovah?​—1Co 10:20, 21
