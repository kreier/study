### Evidence of Jehovah’s Blessing

**8:6-9, 12; 9:1-5, 23, 24** from [workbook November 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-30-December-6-2020/Evidence-of-Jehovahs-Blessing/)

Jehovah caused fire to consume the first burnt offering of the newly installed Aaronic priesthood. This demonstrated Jehovah’s support and approval of this arrangement. Jehovah thus encouraged the assembled nation of onlookers to give the priesthood its full support. Today, Jehovah is using the glorified Jesus Christ as the greater High Priest. (Heb 9:11, 12) In 1919, Jesus appointed a small group of anointed men as “the faithful and discreet slave.” (Mt 24:45) What evidence is there that the faithful slave has Jehovah’s blessing, support, and approval?

- Despite relentless persecution, the faithful slave has continued to supply spiritual food
- As prophesied, the good news is being preached “in all the inhabited earth.”​—Mt 24:14
