### Learn From the Laws on Leprosy

**13:4, 5, 45, 46, 52, 57** from [workbook December 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/december-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-14-20-2020/Learn-From-the-Laws-on-Leprosy/)

What can the principles behind the laws on leprosy teach us about protecting our spiritual health?

- Jehovah taught the priests how to identify leprosy quickly. Christian shepherds today are quick to give attention to any who require spiritual assistance.​—Jas 5:14, 15
- Israelites had to destroy any items infected with leprosy to prevent further contamination. Christians too must be willing to give up even something precious to them rather than allowing it to lead them into sin. (Mt 18:8, 9) This may include such things as habits, associations, or entertainment
