### The Jubilee Year and Future Liberty

from [workbook January-February 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-January-25-31-2021/The-Jubilee-Year-and-Future-Liberty/)

- The Jubilee year helped to prevent endless debt and poverty in Israel (Le 25:10; it-1 871; see cover picture)
- The sale of land was essentially a lease based on the value of crops the land would produce (Le 25:15; it-1 1200 ¶2)
- Jehovah blessed his people when they obeyed the law of the Jubilee year (Le 25:18-22; it-2 122-123)

In the near future, faithful humans will enjoy the full benefits of the symbolic Jubilee when they are completely liberated from sin and death.​—Ro 8:21.
