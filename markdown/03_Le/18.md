### Maintain Moral Purity

from [workbook January-February 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-January-4-10-2021/Maintain-Moral-Purity/)

- Jehovah expects us to behave differently from people in the world (Le 18:3; w19.06 28 ¶1)
- Jehovah forbids such sins as incest, homosexuality, and bestiality (Le 18:6, 22, 23; w17.02 20 ¶13)
- Jehovah will destroy the unclean world around us (Le 18:24, 25; Pr 2:22; w14 7/1 7 ¶2)

Satan does not want us to enter God’s new world. But Jehovah’s principles can protect us from any satanic trap.
