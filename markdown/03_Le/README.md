### The Purpose of Offerings

**1:3; 2:1, 12; 3:1** from [workbook November 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-9-15-2020/The-Purpose-of-Offerings/)

The offerings, or sacrifices, commanded under the Law covenant pleased Jehovah and pointed to Jesus and the ransom sacrifice or to the benefits from that sacrifice.​—Heb 8:3-5; 9:9; 10:5-10.

- Just as all animals to be sacrificed were to be sound and unblemished, Jesus sacrificed his perfect, unblemished body.​—1Pe 1:18, 19
- Just as burnt offerings were presented in their entirety to God, Jesus gave himself wholly to Jehovah
- Just as those who offered an acceptable communion sacrifice were at peace with God, the anointed who share in the Lord’s Evening Meal are at peace with God

### Regulations for sacrifices (1:1–7:38)

The various sacrifices fall into two general categories (from [si](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/All-Scripture-Is-Inspired-of-God-and-Beneficial/Bible-Book-Number-3-Leviticus/) 1990): 

- *blood*, cattle, sheep, goats, and fowl
- *bloodless*, consisting of grain

The **blood** sacrifices are to be offered as either 

1) burnt
2) communion
3) sin
4) guilt offerings

All four have these three things in common: 

- The offerer must himself bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting.
- He must lay his hands upon it.
- The animal is to be slaughtered.

## Leviticus 2

```
The grain offering (1-16)
```

#### Le 2:13​—Why did salt have to be presented with every offering? (Eze 43:24; w04 5/15 22 ¶1)

This was not done to enhance the flavor of the sacrifices. Around the world, salt is used as a preservative. It was likely presented with offerings because it represents freedom from corruption and decay.

## Leviticus 3

```
The communion offering (1-17)
  Do not eat fat or blood (17)
```

#### Le 3:17​—Why were the Israelites prohibited from eating fat, and what lesson does this teach? (it-1 813; w04 5/15 22 ¶2)

Since the fat was regarded as the best or the richest part, the prohibition against eating it evidently impressed upon the Israelites that the best part belonged to Jehovah. (Genesis 45:18) This reminds us that we should give our very best to Jehovah.​—Proverbs 3:9, 10; Colossians 3:23, 24.

## Leviticus 4

```
The sin offering (1-35)
```


## Leviticus 5

```
Specific sins and required offerings (1-6)
  Reporting sins of others (1)
Alternative offerings for the poor (7-13)
The guilt offering for unintentional sins (14-19)
```

#### Le 5:1​—How does this verse apply to Christians? (w16.02 30 ¶14)

Kindness can help you to deal with a conflict of loyalties. For example, you may have definite knowledge that a certain fellow believer is guilty of serious misconduct. You may feel loyal to him, especially if he is a close friend or a relative. But if you were to cover up the wrongdoing, you would be disloyal to God. Of course, your loyalty to Jehovah should come first. So like Nathan, be kind yet firm. Urge your friend or relative to seek the help of the elders. If he or she does not do so within a reasonable period of time, loyalty to God should move you to report the matter to the elders. In doing this, you are being loyal to Jehovah and kind to your friend or relative, for Christian elders will try to readjust such an individual with mildness.​—Read Leviticus 5:1; Galatians 6:1.

#### Le 5:15, 16​—How might someone have ‘behaved unfaithfully by unintentionally sinning against the holy things of Jehovah’? (it-1 1130 ¶2)

The firstborn males of cattle, sheep, and goats were counted as holy to Jehovah and were not to be redeemed. They were to be sacrificed, and a portion went to the sanctified priests. (Nu 18:17-19) The firstfruits and the tithe were holy, as were all sacrifices and all gifts sanctified to the service of the sanctuary. (Ex 28:38) All things holy to Jehovah were sacred and could not be considered lightly or used in a common, or profane, way. An example is the law regarding the tithe. If a man set aside the portion to be tithed, say, of his wheat crop, and then he or one of his household unintentionally took some of it for home use, such as cooking, the man was guilty of violating God’s law respecting holy things. The Law required that he make compensation to the sanctuary of an equal amount plus 20 percent, besides offering up a sound ram of the flock as a sacrifice. Thus, great respect was engendered for the holy things belonging to Jehovah.​—Le 5:14-16.

### Give Jehovah Your Best

**5:5-7, 11** from [workbook November 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-16-22-2020/Give-Jehovah-Your-Best/)

Poverty denied no one in Israel the privilege of making peace with Jehovah. Even the poorest Israelites could give Jehovah an acceptable offering, as long as it was their best. They could offer flour, but Jehovah still expected it to be “fine,” the kind used for honored guests. (Ge 18:6) Today, Jehovah accepts our best “sacrifice of praise,” regardless of how much our personal circumstances may limit what we can give.​—Heb 13:15.

How can this encourage you if you cannot do all that you did before, perhaps because of declining health or stamina?

#### Le 6:13​—What is a traditional Jewish view of the origin of the fire on the altar, but what do the Scriptures indicate? ([it-1 833 ¶1 Fire](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/Insight-on-the-Scriptures/Fire/#p5))

Fire figured in the worship carried on at the tabernacle and then later at the temple. Each morning and between the two evenings, the high priest was to burn incense on the altar of incense. (Ex 30:7, 8) God’s law required that the fire on the altar of burnt offering be kept burning continually. (Le 6:12, 13) The traditional Jewish view that the altar fire was originally kindled miraculously by God, though widely accepted, is not actually supported by the Scriptures. According to Jehovah’s initial instructions to Moses, the sons of Aaron were to “put fire on the altar and set wood in order on the fire” before placing the sacrifice on the altar. (Le 1:7, 8) It was *after* the installation of the Aaronic priesthood, and therefore after the installation sacrifices had been offered, that fire from Jehovah, probably proceeding from the cloud over the tabernacle, consumed the offering then upon the altar. In view of this, the miraculous fire manifested itself, not in kindling the wood on the altar, but in “consuming the burnt offering and the fatty pieces upon the altar.” The fire that then continued to burn on the altar, of course, was likely a result of the mixture of the fire from God and the fire already on the altar. (Le 8:14–9:24) Likewise, miraculous fire from Jehovah consumed the sacrifices right after Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the temple.​—2Ch 7:1; see also Jg 6:21; 1Ki 18:21-39; 1Ch 21:26 for other examples of Jehovah’s use of miraculous fire when accepting the offerings of his servants.

#### Le 6:25​—How were sin offerings different from burnt offerings and communion offerings? (si 27 ¶15)

A sin offering is required for unintentional sins, or sins committed by mistake. The type of animal offered depends upon whose sin is being atoned for​—that of the priest, the people as a whole, a chieftain, or an ordinary person. Unlike the voluntary burnt and communion offerings for individuals, the sin offering is mandatory.​—4:1-35; 6:24-30.

### An Expression of Thanksgiving

**7:11-15, 20** from [workbook November 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-23-29-2020/An-Expression-of-Thanksgiving/)

Communion sacrifices in Israel remind us of the importance of expressing our appreciation to Jehovah in our prayers and by our conduct.​—Php 4:6, 7; Col 3:15.

- When we pray, what specific things can we thank Jehovah for?​—1Th 5:17, 18
- How does showing thankfulness benefit us?
- How might someone partake of “the table of demons,” and how would this show a lack of appreciation to Jehovah?​—1Co 10:20, 21

## Leviticus 8

```
Installation of the Aaronic priesthood (1-36)
```

#### Le 8:6​—What can we learn from the requirement that Israel’s priesthood be physically clean? (w14 11/15 9 ¶6)

The requirement that Israel’s priesthood be physically clean has real meaning for Jehovah’s people today. Those with whom we study the Bible often notice that our places of worship are clean and also how neat and well-dressed we are. Yet, the cleanness of the priesthood helps us to realize that anyone who ascends the elevated mountain of Jehovah’s worship must have “a pure heart.” (Read Psalm 24:3, 4; Isa. 2:2, 3.) Our sacred service to God must be rendered with cleansed minds and hearts as well as with clean bodies. This calls for frequent self-examination, after which some may need to make significant changes so that they can be holy. (2 Cor. 13:5) For instance, a baptized person who deliberately views pornography should ask himself, ‘Am I proving myself holy?’ Then he ought to get help to end that vile practice.—Jas. 5:14.

#### Le 8:14-17​—During the installation of the priesthood, why did Moses offer the sacrifices and not Aaron? (it-2 437 ¶3)

God constituted Moses mediator of the Law covenant with Israel, an intimate position such as no man has ever held before God except Jesus Christ, the Mediator of the new covenant. With the blood of animal sacrifices Moses sprinkled the book of the covenant, representing Jehovah as one “party,” and the people (no doubt the representative older men) as the other “party.” He read the book of the covenant to the people, who replied, “All that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do and be obedient.” (Ex 24:3-8; Heb 9:19) In his office of mediator, Moses was privileged to oversee the building of the tabernacle and the making of its utensils, the pattern of which God gave to him, and to install the priesthood in office, anointing the tabernacle and Aaron the high priest with the oil of special composition. Then he took oversight of the first official services of the newly consecrated priesthood.​—Ex chaps 25-29; Le chaps 8, 9.

## Leviticus 9

Aaron makes offerings (1-24)
```

### Evidence of Jehovah’s Blessing

**8:6-9, 12; 9:1-5, 23, 24** from [workbook November 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-30-December-6-2020/Evidence-of-Jehovahs-Blessing/)

Jehovah caused fire to consume the first burnt offering of the newly installed Aaronic priesthood. This demonstrated Jehovah’s support and approval of this arrangement. Jehovah thus encouraged the assembled nation of onlookers to give the priesthood its full support. Today, Jehovah is using the glorified Jesus Christ as the greater High Priest. (Heb 9:11, 12) In 1919, Jesus appointed a small group of anointed men as “the faithful and discreet slave.” (Mt 24:45) What evidence is there that the faithful slave has Jehovah’s blessing, support, and approval?

- Despite relentless persecution, the faithful slave has continued to supply spiritual food
- As prophesied, the good news is being preached “in all the inhabited earth.”​—Mt 24:14
