## Leviticus 1

```
The burnt offering (1-17)
```

### The Purpose of Offerings

**1:3; 2:1, 12; 3:1** from [workbook November 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-9-15-2020/The-Purpose-of-Offerings/)

The offerings, or sacrifices, commanded under the Law covenant pleased Jehovah and pointed to Jesus and the ransom sacrifice or to the benefits from that sacrifice.​—Heb 8:3-5; 9:9; 10:5-10.

- Just as all animals to be sacrificed were to be sound and unblemished, Jesus sacrificed his perfect, unblemished body.​—1Pe 1:18, 19
- Just as burnt offerings were presented in their entirety to God, Jesus gave himself wholly to Jehovah
- Just as those who offered an acceptable communion sacrifice were at peace with God, the anointed who share in the Lord’s Evening Meal are at peace with God

### Regulations for sacrifices (1:1–7:38)

The various sacrifices fall into two general categories (from [si](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/All-Scripture-Is-Inspired-of-God-and-Beneficial/Bible-Book-Number-3-Leviticus/) 1990): 

- *blood*, cattle, sheep, goats, and fowl
- *bloodless*, consisting of grain

The **blood** sacrifices are to be offered as either 

1) burnt
2) communion
3) sin
4) guilt offerings

All four have these three things in common: 

- The offerer must himself bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting.
- He must lay his hands upon it.
- The animal is to be slaughtered.
