#### Le 19:9, 10​—How did God’s Law show consideration for the poor? (w06 6/15 22 ¶11)

A second aspect of the Mosaic Law that reflected God’s concern for his people’s welfare was the right to glean. Jehovah ordered that when an Israelite farmer reaped the fruits of his field, the needy should be allowed to collect what harvest workers left behind. Farmers were not to reap the edges of their fields completely, nor were they to gather the leftover grapes or olives. Sheaves of grain inadvertently left in the fields should not be retrieved. This was a loving arrangement in behalf of the poor, the alien residents, the orphans, and the widows. Granted, gleaning required hard work on their part, yet by means of it, they could avoid having to beg.​—Leviticus 19:9, 10; Deuteronomy 24:19-22; Psalm 37:25.
