## 1 Samuel 3

```
Samuel called to be a prophet (1-21)
```

#### 1Sa 3:3​—How do we know that Samuel did not sleep in the Most Holy? (w05 3/15 21 ¶6)

Samuel was a Levite of the nonpriestly family of the Kohathites. (1 Chronicles 6:33-38) As such, he was not permitted to “come in to see the holy things.” (Numbers 4:17-20) The only part of the sanctuary that Samuel had access to was the tabernacle courtyard. That is where he must have slept. Apparently, Eli also slept  somewhere in the courtyard. The expression “where the ark of God was” evidently refers to the tabernacle area.

### Jehovah Is Considerate

from [workbook January–February 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-14-20-2022/Jehovah-Is-Considerate/)

- Samuel thought that Eli was calling him (1Sa 3:4-7; w18.09 24 ¶3)
- Jehovah made it clear that He was calling Samuel (1Sa 3:8, 9)
- Jehovah showed kind consideration for young Samuel (1Sa 3:15-18; w18.09 24 ¶4)

**ASK YOURSELF:** ‘In what ways can I show consideration for younger ones and older ones? How can I show consideration for others at Christian meetings?’
