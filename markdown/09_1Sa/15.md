#### 1Sa 15:24​—What warning lesson does Saul’s mistake teach us about compassion? (it-1 493)

Yielding to pressure to show compassion when it is contrary to God’s will can have serious consequences. This is revealed in what happened to King Saul. The time had come for the execution of divine judgment against the Amalekites, the first people to stage an unprovoked attack on the Israelites after their departure from Egypt. Saul was commanded not to have compassion on them. Giving in to the pressure of his subjects, he did not follow through completely on Jehovah’s command. Therefore, Jehovah rejected Saul from being king. (1Sa 15:2-24) A person’s cultivating deep appreciation for the rightness of Jehovah’s ways and putting loyalty to Him foremost can prevent his erring, as did Saul, and losing divine approval.

- Jehovah’s prophet gave King Saul specific instructions (1Sa 15:3)
- Saul tried to justify not obeying Jehovah fully (1Sa 15:13-15)
- Jehovah does not accept worship from those who are disobedient (1Sa 15:22, 23; w07 6/15 26 ¶4; it-2 521 ¶2)

**ASK YOURSELF,** ‘Do I obey instructions from Jehovah’s organization promptly and completely?’
