## 1 Samuel 16

```
Samuel anoints David as next king (1-13)
  “Jehovah sees into the heart” (7)
God’s spirit removed from Saul (14-17)
David becomes harpist for Saul (18-23)
```

#### 1Sa 16:14​—In what sense did Saul receive “a bad spirit from Jehovah”? (it-2 871-872)

It was after this and after the anointing of David as Israel’s future king that Jehovah’s spirit left Saul. From then on “a bad spirit from Jehovah  terrorized him.” Having withdrawn his spirit from Saul, Jehovah made it possible for a bad spirit to gain possession of him, depriving Saul of his peace of mind and stirring up his feelings, thoughts, and imaginations in a wrong way. Saul’s failure to obey Jehovah indicated a bad inclination of mind and heart, against which God’s spirit offered Saul no protection or resistive force. However, since Jehovah had permitted the “bad spirit” to replace his spirit and terrorize Saul, it could be termed a “bad spirit from Jehovah,” so that Saul’s servants spoke of it as “God’s bad spirit.” On the recommendation of one of his attendants, Saul requested that David be his court musician to calm him when he was troubled by the “bad spirit.”​—1Sa 16:14-23; 17:15.
