### Wait Patiently on Jehovah

from [workbook March–April 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-18-24-2022/Wait-Patiently-on-Jehovah/)

- David had an opportunity to end his trial (1Sa 24:3-5)
- David viewed his situation from Jehovah’s standpoint and exercised restraint (1Sa 24:6, 7)
- David had faith that Jehovah would resolve matters (1Sa 24:12, 15; w04 4/1 16 ¶8)

Like David, we should wait patiently on Jehovah instead of using unscriptural means to end trials.​—Jas 1:4; w04 6/1 22-23.
