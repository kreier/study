### Open Your Heart to Jehovah in Prayer

from [workbook January–February 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-7-13-2022/Open-Your-Heart-to-Jehovah-in-Prayer/)

- Hannah prayed at length to Jehovah (1Sa 1:10, 12, 15; ia 55 ¶12)
- Hannah left her problems in Jehovah’s hands (1Sa 1:18; w07 3/15 16 ¶4)
- When we pour out our heart before Jehovah, we can trust that he will strengthen and sustain us.​—Ps 55:22; 62:8.

## 1 Samuel 2

```
Hannah’s prayer (1-11)
Sins of Eli’s two sons (12-26)
Jehovah judges the house of Eli (27-36)
```

#### 1Sa 2:10​—Why did Hannah pray that Jehovah “give power to his king” when there was no human king over Israel? (w05 3/15 21 ¶5)

That the Israelites would have a human king was foretold in the Mosaic Law. (Deuteronomy 17:14-18) In his deathbed prophecy, Jacob said: “The scepter [a symbol of royal authority] will not turn aside from Judah.” (Genesis 49:10) Moreover, concerning Sarah​—the ancestress of the Israelites—​Jehovah said: “Kings of peoples will come from her.” (Genesis 17:16) Hannah, then, was praying about a future king.

## 1 Samuel 3

```
Samuel called to be a prophet (1-21)
```

#### 1Sa 3:3​—How do we know that Samuel did not sleep in the Most Holy? (w05 3/15 21 ¶6)

Samuel was a Levite of the nonpriestly family of the Kohathites. (1 Chronicles 6:33-38) As such, he was not permitted to “come in to see the holy things.” (Numbers 4:17-20) The only part of the sanctuary that Samuel had access to was the tabernacle courtyard. That is where he must have slept. Apparently, Eli also slept  somewhere in the courtyard. The expression “where the ark of God was” evidently refers to the tabernacle area.

### Jehovah Is Considerate

from [workbook January–February 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-14-20-2022/Jehovah-Is-Considerate/)

- Samuel thought that Eli was calling him (1Sa 3:4-7; w18.09 24 ¶3)
- Jehovah made it clear that He was calling Samuel (1Sa 3:8, 9)
- Jehovah showed kind consideration for young Samuel (1Sa 3:15-18; w18.09 24 ¶4)

**ASK YOURSELF:** ‘In what ways can I show consideration for younger ones and older ones? How can I show consideration for others at Christian meetings?’

## 1 Samuel 4

```
Philistines capture the Ark (1-11)
Eli and his sons die (12-22)
```

## 1 Samuel 5

```
The Ark in Philistine territory (1-12)
  Dagon humiliated (1-5)
  Philistines scourged (6-12)
```

## 1 Samuel 6

```
Philistines return the Ark to Israel (1-21)
```

## 1 Samuel 7

```
The Ark in Kiriath-jearim (1)
Samuel urges: ‘Serve only Jehovah’ (2-6)
Israel’s victory at Mizpah (7-14)
Samuel judges Israel (15-17)
```

#### 1Sa 7:3​—What does this verse teach us about conversion and repentance? (w02 4/1 12 ¶13)

Conversion must take place prior to our baptism as Witnesses of Jehovah. Conversion is a voluntary act performed freely by one who has made a wholehearted decision to follow Christ Jesus. Such individuals reject their former wrong course and determine to do what is right in God’s sight. In the Scriptures, Hebrew and Greek verbs pertaining to conversion have the sense of turning back, turning around. This action denotes a turning to God from a wrong way. (1 Kings 8:33, 34) Conversion calls for “works that befit repentance.” (Acts 26:20) It requires that we abandon false worship, act in harmony with God’s commandments, and render exclusive devotion to Jehovah. (Deuteronomy 30:2, 8-10; 1 Samuel 7:3) Conversion results in changes in our thinking, objectives, and disposition. (Ezekiel 18:31) We “turn around” as ungodly traits are replaced by the new personality.​—Acts 3:19; Ephesians 4:20-24; Colossians 3:5-14.

## 1 Samuel 8

```
Israel demands a king (1-9)
Samuel warns the people (10-18)
Jehovah grants the request for a king (19-22)
```

### Who Is Your King?

from [workbook January–February 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-21-27-2022/Who-Is-Your-King/)

- The Israelites presumptuously requested a human king (1Sa 8:4, 5; it-2 163 ¶1)
- The Israelites were not content to have Jehovah as their invisible Ruler (1Sa 8:7, 8; w11 1/1 27 ¶1)
- Jehovah warned them of the consequences of their request (1Sa 8:9, 18; w10 1/15 30 ¶9)

Jehovah has always exercised his sovereignty over all his creation. His rulership is kind and dignifies his subjects. Our obeying and supporting his rulership will result in eternal blessings.

## 1 Samuel 9

```
Samuel meets with Saul (1-27)
```

#### 1Sa 9:9​—What might these words have signified? (w05 3/15 22 ¶8)

**What is significant about the expression “the prophet of today used to be called a seer in former times”?** These words may indicate that as the prophets became more prominent in the days of Samuel and during the era of the kings in Israel, the word “seer” came to be replaced by the term “prophet.” Samuel is considered the first of the line of the prophets.​—Acts 3:24.

## 1 Samuel 10

```
Saul anointed to be king (1-16)
Saul presented to the people (17-27)
```

### Saul Started Out Humble and Modest

from [workbook January–February 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-28-March-6-2022/Saul-Started-Out-Humble-and-Modest/)

- Saul was modest and hesitated to accept the kingship (1Sa 9:21; 10:20-22; w20.08 10 ¶11)
- Saul did not act rashly when others spoke negatively of him (1Sa 10:27; 11:12, 13; w14 3/15 9 ¶8)
- Saul responded to the leadings of Jehovah’s holy spirit (1Sa 11:5-7; w95 12/15 10 ¶1)

Humility will help us to view our privileges and abilities as gifts from Jehovah. (Ro 12:3, 16; 1Co 4:7) Also, if we are humble, we will continue to rely on Jehovah for guidance.

## 1 Samuel 11

```
Saul defeats the Ammonites (1-11)
Saul’s kingship reconfirmed (12-15)
```

## 1 Samuel 12

```
Samuel’s farewell speech (1-25)
  ‘Do not follow empty things’ (21)
  Jehovah will not abandon his people (22)
```

#### 1Sa 12:21​—How could the people have been following “empty things” (or, “unrealities,” ftn.)? (w11 7/15 13 ¶15)

Did those people think that a human king would  somehow be more real, more dependable, than Jehovah? If so, they were truly pursuing an unreality! And they were in danger of pursuing many other satanic illusions. Human kings would easily lead them into idolatry. Idolaters make the mistake of thinking that physical objects​—gods made of wood or stone—​are somehow more real, more reliable, than the invisible God, Jehovah, who created all things. But as the apostle Paul noted, idols are “nothing.” (1 Cor. 8:4) They cannot see, hear, speak, or act. You might be able to see them and touch them, but if you were to worship one, you would, indeed, be pursuing an unreality​—an empty illusion that would bring only disaster.​—Ps. 115:4-8.

## 1 Samuel 13

```
Saul selects an army (1-4)
Saul acts presumptuously (5-9)
Samuel reproves Saul (10-14)
Israel without weapons (15-23)
```

### Presumptuousness Leads to Dishonor

from [workbook March–April 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-7-13-2022/Presumptuousness-Leads-to-Dishonor/)

- King Saul felt that he was in a desperate situation (1Sa 13:5-7)
- Rather than modestly following Jehovah’s instructions, Saul acted presumptuously (1Sa 13:8, 9; w00 8/1 13 ¶17)
- Jehovah disciplined Saul (1Sa 13:13, 14; w07 6/15 27 ¶8)

Someone acts presumptuously when he rashly or foolishly does something that he is not authorized to do. Presumptuousness is contrasted with modesty. What situations could tempt someone to be presumptuous?

## 1 Samuel 14

```
Jonathan’s exploit at Michmash (1-14)
Israel’s enemies routed by God (15-23)
Saul’s rash oath (24-46)
  People eat meat with the blood (32-34)
Saul’s wars; his family (47-52)
```

## 1 Samuel 15

```
Saul disobediently spares Agag (1-9) 
Samuel reproves Saul (10-23)
  “To obey is better than a sacrifice” (22)
Saul rejected as king (24-29)
Samuel kills Agag (30-35)
```

#### 1Sa 15:24​—What warning lesson does Saul’s mistake teach us about compassion? (it-1 493)

Yielding to pressure to show compassion when it is contrary to God’s will can have serious consequences. This is revealed in what happened to King Saul. The time had come for the execution of divine judgment against the Amalekites, the first people to stage an unprovoked attack on the Israelites after their departure from Egypt. Saul was commanded not to have compassion on them. Giving in to the pressure of his subjects, he did not follow through completely on Jehovah’s command. Therefore, Jehovah rejected Saul from being king. (1Sa 15:2-24) A person’s cultivating deep appreciation for the rightness of Jehovah’s ways and putting loyalty to Him foremost can prevent his erring, as did Saul, and losing divine approval.

### Obedience Is Better Than a Sacrifice

from [workbook March–April 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-14-20-2022/Obedience-Is-Better-Than-a-Sacrifice/)

- Jehovah’s prophet gave King Saul specific instructions (1Sa 15:3)
- Saul tried to justify not obeying Jehovah fully (1Sa 15:13-15)
- Jehovah does not accept worship from those who are disobedient (1Sa 15:22, 23; w07 6/15 26 ¶4; it-2 521 ¶2)

**ASK YOURSELF,** ‘Do I obey instructions from Jehovah’s organization promptly and completely?’

## 1 Samuel 16

```
Samuel anoints David as next king (1-13)
  “Jehovah sees into the heart” (7)
God’s spirit removed from Saul (14-17)
David becomes harpist for Saul (18-23)
```

#### 1Sa 16:14​—In what sense did Saul receive “a bad spirit from Jehovah”? (it-2 871-872)

It was after this and after the anointing of David as Israel’s future king that Jehovah’s spirit left Saul. From then on “a bad spirit from Jehovah  terrorized him.” Having withdrawn his spirit from Saul, Jehovah made it possible for a bad spirit to gain possession of him, depriving Saul of his peace of mind and stirring up his feelings, thoughts, and imaginations in a wrong way. Saul’s failure to obey Jehovah indicated a bad inclination of mind and heart, against which God’s spirit offered Saul no protection or resistive force. However, since Jehovah had permitted the “bad spirit” to replace his spirit and terrorize Saul, it could be termed a “bad spirit from Jehovah,” so that Saul’s servants spoke of it as “God’s bad spirit.” On the recommendation of one of his attendants, Saul requested that David be his court musician to calm him when he was troubled by the “bad spirit.”​—1Sa 16:14-23; 17:15.

## 1 Samuel 17

```
David defeats Goliath (1-58)
  Goliath taunts Israel (8-10)
  David accepts the challenge (32-37)
  David fights in Jehovah’s name (45-47)
```

### “The Battle Belongs to Jehovah”

from [workbook March–April 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-21-27-2022/The-Battle-Belongs-to-Jehovah/)

- David’s faith in Jehovah was based on knowledge and experience (1Sa 17:36, 37; wp16.5 11 ¶2-3)
- David looked at Goliath in comparison to Jehovah, not himself (1Sa 17:45-47; wp16.5 11-12)
- Jehovah gave David the victory over an imposing enemy (1Sa 17:48-50; wp16.5 12 ¶4; see cover picture)

At times, we may face huge challenges, such as persecution or a bad habit. When problems seem too big, remember that they are small in comparison to Jehovah’s limitless power.​—Job 42:1, 2.

## 1 Samuel 18

```
David and Jonathan’s friendship (1-4)
David’s victories make Saul jealous (5-9)
Saul attempts to kill David (10-19)
David marries Saul’s daughter Michal (20-30)
```

### Remain Humble When Successful

from [workbook March–April 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-28-April-3-2022/Remain-Humble-When-Successful/)

- David received praise from the people (1Sa 18:5-7; w04 4/1 15 ¶4)
- Jehovah gave David success in all he did (1Sa 18:14)
- David remained humble (1Sa 18:22, 23; w18.01 28 ¶6-7)

Why is it important for us to remain humble when we receive blessings from Jehovah? What will help us to remain humble?

## 1 Samuel 19

```
Saul continues to hate David (1-13)
David escapes from Saul (14-24)
```

#### 1Sa 19:23, 24​—In what way might King Saul have behaved “as a prophet”? (it-2 695-696)

Though appointed by Jehovah’s spirit, it does not appear that the prophets spoke continually  under inspiration. Rather, God’s spirit ‘came upon them’ at certain times, revealing the messages to be announced. (Eze 11:4, 5; Mic 3:8) This had a stirring effect upon them, impelling them to speak. (1Sa 10:10; Jer 20:9; Am 3:8) Not only did they do things that were out of the ordinary but also their expression and manner doubtless reflected intensity and feeling that were truly extraordinary. This may explain in part what is meant by individuals’ “behaving like prophets.” (1Sa 10:6-11; 19:20-24; Jer 29:24-32; compare Ac 2:4, 12-17; 6:15; 7:55.) Their total concentration and zealous boldness in their mission might cause their behavior to appear strange, even irrational, to others, just as a prophet so appeared to military chiefs when Jehu was anointed. Yet, on realizing that the man was a prophet, the chiefs accepted his message with full seriousness. (2Ki 9:1-13; compare Ac 26:24, 25.) When Saul, in pursuit of David, was caused to ‘behave like a prophet,’ he stripped off his garments and lay “naked all that day and all that night,” during which time David evidently escaped. (1Sa 19:18–20:1) This does not mean that prophets frequently went naked, for the Biblical record shows the contrary. In the two other cases recorded, the prophet went naked for a purpose, to represent some facet of his prophecy. (Isa 20:2-4; Mic 1:8-11) The reason for Saul’s nakedness​—whether to show him as a mere man, divested of his royal garments, impotent against Jehovah’s own regal authority and power, or for some other purpose—​is not stated.

## 1 Samuel 20

```
Jonathan’s loyalty to David (1-42)
```

### How to Be a Good Friend

from [workbook March–April 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-4-10-2022/How-to-Be-a-Good-Friend/)

- Comfort and encourage your friend when he is distressed (1Sa 20:1, 2; w19.11 7 ¶18)
- Warn your friend when there is danger (1Sa 20:12, 13; w08 2/15 8 ¶7)
- Defend your friend when he is slandered (1Sa 20:30-32; w09 10/15 19 ¶11)

Jehovah’s people have many opportunities to develop good friendships. To have a friend, we must be a friend. Whom would you like to befriend in the congregation?

## 1 Samuel 21

```
David eats the showbread at Nob (1-9)
David feigns insanity in Gath (10-15)
```

#### 1Sa 21:12, 13​—What can we learn from David’s actions? (w05 3/15 24 ¶4)

Jehovah expects us to use our mental faculties and abilities to deal with difficult situations in life. He has given us his inspired Word, which imparts prudence, knowledge, and thinking ability. (Proverbs 1:4) We also have the help of appointed Christian elders.

## 1 Samuel 22

```
David at Adullam and Mizpeh (1-5)
Saul has the priests of Nob killed (6-19)
Abiathar escapes (20-23)
```

## 1 Samuel 23

```
David saves the city of Keilah (1-12)
Saul pursues David (13-15)
Jonathan strengthens David (16-18)
David narrowly escapes Saul (19-29)
```

#### 1Sa 23:16, 17​—How can we imitate Jonathan’s example? (w17.11 27 ¶11)

If we cultivate love and kindness in our heart, we will not easily become jealous. God’s Word says: “Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous.” (1 Cor. 13:4) To prevent jealousy from taking root in our heart, we must strive to see things from God’s standpoint, viewing our brothers and sisters as members of the same Christian body. This will help us to show fellow feeling, in harmony with the inspired counsel: “If a member is glorified, all the other members rejoice with it.” (1 Cor. 12:16-18, 26) Thus, rather than feel jealous, we will be happy when others receive blessings. Consider the example of King Saul’s son Jonathan. He was not jealous when David was appointed heir to the throne. Rather, he encouraged David. (1 Sam. 23:16-18) Could we be as kind and loving as Jonathan?

## 1 Samuel 24

```
David spares Saul’s life (1-22)
  David respects Jehovah’s anointed (6)
```

### Wait Patiently on Jehovah

from [workbook March–April 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-18-24-2022/Wait-Patiently-on-Jehovah/)

- David had an opportunity to end his trial (1Sa 24:3-5)
- David viewed his situation from Jehovah’s standpoint and exercised restraint (1Sa 24:6, 7)
- David had faith that Jehovah would resolve matters (1Sa 24:12, 15; w04 4/1 16 ¶8)

Like David, we should wait patiently on Jehovah instead of using unscriptural means to end trials.​—Jas 1:4; w04 6/1 22-23.

## 1 Samuel 25

```
Death of Samuel (1)
Nabal rejects David’s men (2-13)
Abigail’s wise action (14-35)
  “Bag of life with Jehovah” (29)
Senseless Nabal struck by Jehovah (36-38)
Abigail becomes David’s wife (39-44)
```

#### 1Sa 25:18, 19​—Why can we say that Abigail did not rebel against her husband’s rightful headship? (ia 80 ¶16)

Does this mean that Abigail was rebelling against her husband’s rightful headship? No; keep in mind that Nabal had acted wickedly against an anointed servant of Jehovah, an action that could well result in death for many innocent members of Nabal’s household. If Abigail failed to act, might she become a sharer in her husband’s guilt? In this case, she had to put submission to her God ahead of submission to her husband.

### Do You Act on Impulse?

from [workbook March–April 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-25-May-1-2022/Do-You-Act-on-Impulse/)

- David’s reasonable request was met with insults (1Sa 25:7-11; ia 78 ¶10-12)
- David’s impulse was to kill the men of Nabal’s household (1Sa 25:13, 21, 22)
- Abigail helped David to avoid bloodguilt (1Sa 25:25, 26, 32, 33; ia 80 ¶18)

**ASK YOURSELF:** ‘Do I tend to act on impulse when I am angry, when I am shopping, or when I am discouraged? Or do I pause to consider the consequences before I act?’​—Pr 15:28; 22:3.
