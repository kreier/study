### How to Be a Good Friend

from [workbook March–April 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-4-10-2022/How-to-Be-a-Good-Friend/)

- Comfort and encourage your friend when he is distressed (1Sa 20:1, 2; w19.11 7 ¶18)
- Warn your friend when there is danger (1Sa 20:12, 13; w08 2/15 8 ¶7)
- Defend your friend when he is slandered (1Sa 20:30-32; w09 10/15 19 ¶11)

Jehovah’s people have many opportunities to develop good friendships. To have a friend, we must be a friend. Whom would you like to befriend in the congregation?
