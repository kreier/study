## 1 Samuel 12

```
Samuel’s farewell speech (1-25)
  ‘Do not follow empty things’ (21)
  Jehovah will not abandon his people (22)
```

#### 1Sa 12:21​—How could the people have been following “empty things” (or, “unrealities,” ftn.)? (w11 7/15 13 ¶15)

Did those people think that a human king would  somehow be more real, more dependable, than Jehovah? If so, they were truly pursuing an unreality! And they were in danger of pursuing many other satanic illusions. Human kings would easily lead them into idolatry. Idolaters make the mistake of thinking that physical objects​—gods made of wood or stone—​are somehow more real, more reliable, than the invisible God, Jehovah, who created all things. But as the apostle Paul noted, idols are “nothing.” (1 Cor. 8:4) They cannot see, hear, speak, or act. You might be able to see them and touch them, but if you were to worship one, you would, indeed, be pursuing an unreality​—an empty illusion that would bring only disaster.​—Ps. 115:4-8.
