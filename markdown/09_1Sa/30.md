## 1 Samuel 30

```
Amalekites raid and burn Ziklag (1-6)
  David draws strength from God (6)
David defeats the Amalekites (7-31)
  Captives retaken by David (18, 19)
  David’s regulation on spoil (23, 24)
```

#### 1Sa 30:23, 24​—What do we learn from this account? (w05 3/15 24 ¶8)

This decision, based on Numbers 31:27, shows that Jehovah values those who serve in supportive roles in the congregation. Whatever we are doing, then, let us “work at it whole-souled as to Jehovah, and not to men.”​—Colossians 3:23.
