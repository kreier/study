## 1 Samuel 25

```
Death of Samuel (1)
Nabal rejects David’s men (2-13)
Abigail’s wise action (14-35)
  “Bag of life with Jehovah” (29)
Senseless Nabal struck by Jehovah (36-38)
Abigail becomes David’s wife (39-44)
```

#### 1Sa 25:18, 19​—Why can we say that Abigail did not rebel against her husband’s rightful headship? (ia 80 ¶16)

Does this mean that Abigail was rebelling against her husband’s rightful headship? No; keep in mind that Nabal had acted wickedly against an anointed servant of Jehovah, an action that could well result in death for many innocent members of Nabal’s household. If Abigail failed to act, might she become a sharer in her husband’s guilt? In this case, she had to put submission to her God ahead of submission to her husband.

- David’s reasonable request was met with insults (1Sa 25:7-11; ia 78 ¶10-12)
- David’s impulse was to kill the men of Nabal’s household (1Sa 25:13, 21, 22)
- Abigail helped David to avoid bloodguilt (1Sa 25:25, 26, 32, 33; ia 80 ¶18)

**ASK YOURSELF:** ‘Do I tend to act on impulse when I am angry, when I am shopping, or when I am discouraged? Or do I pause to consider the consequences before I act?’​—Pr 15:28; 22:3.
