### Presumptuousness Leads to Dishonor

from [workbook March–April 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-7-13-2022/Presumptuousness-Leads-to-Dishonor/)

- King Saul felt that he was in a desperate situation (1Sa 13:5-7)
- Rather than modestly following Jehovah’s instructions, Saul acted presumptuously (1Sa 13:8, 9; w00 8/1 13 ¶17)
- Jehovah disciplined Saul (1Sa 13:13, 14; w07 6/15 27 ¶8)

Someone acts presumptuously when he rashly or foolishly does something that he is not authorized to do. Presumptuousness is contrasted with modesty. What situations could tempt someone to be presumptuous?
