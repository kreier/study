## 1 Samuel 9

```
Samuel meets with Saul (1-27)
```

#### 1Sa 9:9​—What might these words have signified? (w05 3/15 22 ¶8)

**What is significant about the expression “the prophet of today used to be called a seer in former times”?** These words may indicate that as the prophets became more prominent in the days of Samuel and during the era of the kings in Israel, the word “seer” came to be replaced by the term “prophet.” Samuel is considered the first of the line of the prophets.​—Acts 3:24.
