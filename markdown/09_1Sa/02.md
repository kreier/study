## 1 Samuel 2

```
Hannah’s prayer (1-11)
Sins of Eli’s two sons (12-26)
Jehovah judges the house of Eli (27-36)
```

#### 1Sa 2:10​—Why did Hannah pray that Jehovah “give power to his king” when there was no human king over Israel? (w05 3/15 21 ¶5)

That the Israelites would have a human king was foretold in the Mosaic Law. (Deuteronomy 17:14-18) In his deathbed prophecy, Jacob said: “The scepter [a symbol of royal authority] will not turn aside from Judah.” (Genesis 49:10) Moreover, concerning Sarah​—the ancestress of the Israelites—​Jehovah said: “Kings of peoples will come from her.” (Genesis 17:16) Hannah, then, was praying about a future king.
