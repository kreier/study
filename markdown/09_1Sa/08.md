### Who Is Your King?

from [workbook January–February 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-21-27-2022/Who-Is-Your-King/)

- The Israelites presumptuously requested a human king (1Sa 8:4, 5; it-2 163 ¶1)
- The Israelites were not content to have Jehovah as their invisible Ruler (1Sa 8:7, 8; w11 1/1 27 ¶1)
- Jehovah warned them of the consequences of their request (1Sa 8:9, 18; w10 1/15 30 ¶9)

Jehovah has always exercised his sovereignty over all his creation. His rulership is kind and dignifies his subjects. Our obeying and supporting his rulership will result in eternal blessings.
