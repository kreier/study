## 1 Samuel 21

```
David eats the showbread at Nob (1-9)
David feigns insanity in Gath (10-15)
```

#### 1Sa 21:12, 13​—What can we learn from David’s actions? (w05 3/15 24 ¶4)

Jehovah expects us to use our mental faculties and abilities to deal with difficult situations in life. He has given us his inspired Word, which imparts prudence, knowledge, and thinking ability. (Proverbs 1:4) We also have the help of appointed Christian elders.
