### Saul Started Out Humble and Modest

from [workbook January–February 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-28-March-6-2022/Saul-Started-Out-Humble-and-Modest/)

- Saul was modest and hesitated to accept the kingship (1Sa 9:21; 10:20-22; w20.08 10 ¶11)
- Saul did not act rashly when others spoke negatively of him (1Sa 10:27; 11:12, 13; w14 3/15 9 ¶8)
- Saul responded to the leadings of Jehovah’s holy spirit (1Sa 11:5-7; w95 12/15 10 ¶1)

Humility will help us to view our privileges and abilities as gifts from Jehovah. (Ro 12:3, 16; 1Co 4:7) Also, if we are humble, we will continue to rely on Jehovah for guidance.
