### “The Battle Belongs to Jehovah”

from [workbook March–April 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-21-27-2022/The-Battle-Belongs-to-Jehovah/)

- David’s faith in Jehovah was based on knowledge and experience (1Sa 17:36, 37; wp16.5 11 ¶2-3)
- David looked at Goliath in comparison to Jehovah, not himself (1Sa 17:45-47; wp16.5 11-12)
- Jehovah gave David the victory over an imposing enemy (1Sa 17:48-50; wp16.5 12 ¶4; see cover picture)

At times, we may face huge challenges, such as persecution or a bad habit. When problems seem too big, remember that they are small in comparison to Jehovah’s limitless power.​—Job 42:1, 2.
