### Remain Humble When Successful

from [workbook March–April 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-28-April-3-2022/Remain-Humble-When-Successful/)

- David received praise from the people (1Sa 18:5-7; w04 4/1 15 ¶4)
- Jehovah gave David success in all he did (1Sa 18:14)
- David remained humble (1Sa 18:22, 23; w18.01 28 ¶6-7)

Why is it important for us to remain humble when we receive blessings from Jehovah? What will help us to remain humble?
