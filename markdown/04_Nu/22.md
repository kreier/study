## Numbers 22

```
Balak hires Balaam (1-21)
Balaam’s donkey speaks (22-41)
```

#### Nu 22:20-22​—Why did Jehovah’s anger blaze against Balaam? (w04 8/1 27 ¶2)

Jehovah had told the prophet Balaam that he should not curse the Israelites. (Numbers 22:12) However, the prophet went with Balak’s men with the full intention of cursing Israel. Balaam wanted to please the Moabite king and receive a reward from him. (2 Peter 2:15, 16; Jude 11) Even when Balaam was forced to bless rather than curse Israel, he sought the king’s favor by suggesting that Baal-worshiping women be used to seduce Israelite men. (Numbers 31:15, 16) Thus, the reason for God’s anger against Balaam was the prophet’s unscrupulous greed.

Nothing, including persecution or disasters, can prevent the good news from being preached according to God’s will. When we experience personal hardships, do we rely on our heavenly Father and keep his worship our priority?
