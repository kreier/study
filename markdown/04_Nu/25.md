### Can One Person Make a Difference?

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-26-May-2-2021/Can-One-Person-Make-a-Difference/)

- Israel was lured into wrongdoing by Moab (Nu 25:1, 2; lvs 118 ¶1-2)
- Israel’s disloyalty and selfishness brought Jehovah’s rage (Nu 25:3-5; lvs 119 ¶4)
- Jehovah turned away his wrath because of one person’s decisive act of courage (Nu 25:6-11)

ASK YOURSELF, ‘In what situations do I need courage to stand out as different?’
