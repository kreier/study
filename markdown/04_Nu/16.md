### Beware of Pride and Overconfidence

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-29-April-4-2021/Beware-of-Pride-and-Overconfidence/)

- Korah rebelled against Jehovah’s arrangement because he became proud and overconfident (Nu 16:1-3; w11 9/15 27 ¶12)
- Korah was a respected Levite who already enjoyed many privileges (Nu 16:8-10; w11 9/15 27 ¶11)
- Korah’s wrong thinking had dire consequences (Nu 16:32, 35)

We must not allow our achievements in Jehovah’s service to cause us to develop pride and overconfidence. The longer we have been in the truth or the weightier our responsibilities, the more humble we need to be.
