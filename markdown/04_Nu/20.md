#### Nu 20:23-27​—What lessons can we learn from the way that Aaron reacted to discipline and from the way that Jehovah viewed him despite his mistakes? (w14 6/15 26 ¶12)

In each of these situations, Jehovah could have punished Aaron on the spot. But He discerned that Aaron was not a bad person or gravely at fault. It seems that Aaron allowed circumstances or the influence of others to turn him away from the right course. Yet, when he was confronted with his own mistakes, he readily admitted them and supported Jehovah’s judgments. (Ex. 32:26; Num. 12:11; 20:23-27) Jehovah chose to focus on Aaron’s faith and repentant attitude. Centuries later, Aaron and his descendants were still remembered as fearers of Jehovah.—Ps. 115:10-12; 135:19, 20.

### Maintain Your Meekness When Under Pressure

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-12-18-2021/Maintain-Your-Meekness-When-Under-Pressure/)

- Moses’ meekness was put to the test when he experienced pressure and stress (Nu 20:2-5; w19.02 12 ¶19)
- Moses temporarily lost his meekness (Nu 20:10; w19.02 13 ¶20-21)
- Jehovah disciplined Moses and Aaron for their serious mistake (Nu 20:12; w09 9/1 19 ¶5)

Meekness is a mildness of temper, without haughtiness or vanity. It enables one to endure injury with patience and without irritation, resentment, or retaliation.
