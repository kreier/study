#### Nu 18:19​—What is the meaning of the expression “a lasting covenant of salt”? (g02 6/8 14 ¶2)

Salt also became a symbol of stability and permanence. Therefore, in the Bible a binding covenant was called “a covenant of salt,” the parties often eating a meal together, with salt, to seal it. (Numbers 18:19) Under Mosaic Law, salt was to be added to sacrifices offered on the altar, doubtless denoting freedom from corruption or decay.

### “I Am . . . Your Inheritance”

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-5-11-2021/I-Am-Your-Inheritance/)

- Jehovah gave the priests and the Levites a priceless privilege of service (Nu 18:6, 7)
- The tribe of Levi received no land allotment but had Jehovah as their inheritance (Nu 18:20, 24; w11 9/15 13 ¶9)
- The nation gave a tenth of its produce to support the Levites and the priesthood (Nu 18:21, 26, 27; w11 9/15 7 ¶4)

Jehovah promised the priests and the Levites that he would care for their basic material needs. We can be confident that Jehovah will support us if we make sacrifices to serve him.
