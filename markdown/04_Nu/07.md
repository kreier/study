### Lessons From the Camp of Israel

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-1-7-2021/Lessons-From-the-Camp-of-Israel/)

- Appointed men take the lead in sacred service (Nu 7:10; it-1 497 ¶3)
- God’s servants should be well-organized and orderly (Nu 7:11; it-2 796 ¶1)
- Jehovah considers the limitations of individuals (Nu 8:25, 26; w04 8/1 25 ¶1)

Just as Jehovah organized Israel, he has organized his people today. However, he still sees each one of us and takes note of our individual efforts to serve him.
