## Numbers 30

```
Vows of men (1, 2)
Vows of women and daughters (3-16)
```

#### Nu 30:10-12​—How do we know that Elkanah approved of Hannah’s vow to offer Samuel to Jehovah’s service? (1Sa 1:11; it-2 28 ¶1)

Persons could be devoted to Jehovah’s exclusive service in connection with the sanctuary. It was a right that parents could exercise. Samuel was one such person, promised to tabernacle service by a vow of his mother Hannah before his birth. This vow was approved by her husband Elkanah. As soon as Samuel was weaned, Hannah offered him at the sanctuary. Along with him, Hannah brought an animal sacrifice. (1Sa 1:11, 22-28; 2:11) Samson was another child specially devoted to God’s service as a Nazirite.​—Jg 13:2-5, 11-14; compare the father’s authority over a daughter as outlined in Nu 30:3-5, 16.

### Pay Your Vows

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-May-10-16-2021/Pay-Your-Vows/)

- Israelite vows were voluntary but binding (Nu 30:2; it-2 1162)
- Vows may include abstaining from things not prohibited (Nu 30:3, 4; it-2 1162)
- Jehovah now deals with his worshippers individually (Nu 30:6-9; w04 8/1 27 ¶3)

The two most important vows a Christian can make today are the dedication vow and the marriage vow.
