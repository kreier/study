### The Service of the Levites

from [workbook January-February 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-15-21-2021/The-Service-of-the-Levites/)

- Jehovah took the Levites in place of the firstborn males of Israel (Nu 3:11-13; it-2 683 ¶3)
- The Levites enjoyed precious privileges (Nu 3:25, 26, 31, 36, 37; it-2 241)
- The Levites cared for their full duties between 30 and 50 years of age (Nu 4:46-48; it-2 241)

The males in Aaron’s family performed priestly duties. The rest of the Levites assisted them. Likewise, in the Christian congregation today, some responsible men care for weighty spiritual concerns, while others care for necessary routine matters.

#### Firstborns numbers and redemption

There were 22,273 firstborn males by name from a month old and up in Israel (Nu 3:43). Yet Levi had only 22,000 males serving as priests. The 273 excess of the Levites (Nu 3:46) have to be bought in redemption. Price: 5 shekel (1 shekel is 20 gerah) per person. 273 x 5 = 1365 shekel. 1 shekel equals 11.4 g. Total weight: 15.5561 kg silver. Worth: 11360 USD (2023/07/03 0.7323 USD per gram)
