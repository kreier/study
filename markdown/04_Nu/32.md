#### Nu 33:54​—How was land distributed to the tribes of Israel? (it-1 359 ¶2)

After the casting of the lot had determined the geographic location of a tribe, it would then be necessary to determine the extent of its territory on the basis of the second factor: its proportionate size. “You must apportion the land to yourselves as a possession by lot according to your families. To the populous one you should increase his inheritance, and to the sparse one you should reduce his inheritance. To where the lot will come out for him, there it will become his.” (Nu 33:54) The decision of the lot as to the basic geographic location would stand, but adjustment could be made as to the size of the inheritance. Thus, when Judah’s territory was found to be too large, its land area was reduced by assigning portions of it to the tribe of Simeon.​—Jos 19:9.

### “Drive Away All the Inhabitants of the Land”

- Jehovah commanded his people to eliminate from the Promised Land anything that could stumble them (Nu 33:52; w10 8/1 23)
- Jehovah would bless their determined efforts to take complete control of the land (Nu 33:53)
- Problems would result if the Israelites did not completely conquer their enemies (Nu 33:55, 56; w08 2/15 27 ¶5-6; it-1 404 ¶2)

To please Jehovah, we must eliminate from our life all morally and spiritually defiling practices. (Jas 1:21) Jehovah gives us the strength to combat sinful tendencies and resist the contaminating influences of this world.
