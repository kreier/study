## Numbers 1

```
Registration of men for the army (1-46)
The Levites exempted from the army (47-51)
Orderly arrangement of the camp (52-54)
```

#### Nu 1:2, 3​—What was the purpose of national registrations in Israel? (it-2 764)

An enrollment, usually by name and lineage according to tribe and household. It involved more than a simple census or count of heads. The national registrations referred to in the Bible served various purposes, such as taxation, assignments of military service, or (for those Levites included) appointments to duties at the sanctuary.

### Jehovah Organizes His People

- The Israelites camped according to three-tribe divisions (Nu 1:52, 53; w94 12/1 9 ¶4)
- The Israelite camp may have totaled 3,000,000 or more (Nu 2:32, 33; it-1 397 ¶4)
- Jehovah wants his people to worship him in an organized way. That was true for the nation of Israel, and it is true for us today.​—1Co 14:33, 40.
