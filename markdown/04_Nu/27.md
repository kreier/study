### Imitate Jehovah’s Impartiality

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-May-3-9-2021/Imitate-Jehovahs-Impartiality/)

- Zelophehad’s five daughters sought to preserve the inheritance of their father (Nu 27:1-4; w13 6/15 10 ¶14; see cover picture)
- Jehovah made an impartial decision (Nu 27:5-7; w13 6/15 11 ¶15)
- We too must act impartially (Nu 27:8-11; w13 6/15 11 ¶16)

We imitate Jehovah’s impartiality by treating fellow believers with dignity and loyal love and by preaching to people of all backgrounds.
