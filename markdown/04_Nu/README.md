# Numbers

Written by Moses in the wildernis and the plains of Moab. The writing was completed 1473 B.C.E. The time covered is from 1512 to 1473 B.C.E.

## Numbers 1

```
Registration of men for the army (1-46)
The Levites exempted from the army (47-51)
Orderly arrangement of the camp (52-54)
```

#### Nu 1:2, 3​—What was the purpose of national registrations in Israel? (it-2 764)

An enrollment, usually by name and lineage according to tribe and household. It involved more than a simple census or count of heads. The national registrations referred to in the Bible served various purposes, such as taxation, assignments of military service, or (for those Levites included) appointments to duties at the sanctuary.

### Jehovah Organizes His People

- The Israelites camped according to three-tribe divisions (Nu 1:52, 53; w94 12/1 9 ¶4)
- The Israelite camp may have totaled 3,000,000 or more (Nu 2:32, 33; it-1 397 ¶4)
- Jehovah wants his people to worship him in an organized way. That was true for the nation of Israel, and it is true for us today.​—1Co 14:33, 40.

```
North: Naphtali Dan Asher  (last 2:31) - Merarites
West:  Benjamin Ephraim Manasseh (3rd) - Gershonites
East:  Issachar Judah Zebulun    (1st) - Aaron
South: Gad Reuben Simeon         (2nd) - Kohathites
```

## Numbers 2

```
Camp organized into three-tribe divisions (1-34)
  Judah’s division toward the east (3-9)
  Reuben’s division toward the south (10-16)
  Levi’s camp in the middle (17)
  Ephraim’s division toward the west (18-24)
  Dan’s division toward the north (25-31)
  Total number of registered males (32-34)
```


## Numbers 3

```
Aaron’s sons (1-4)
The Levites chosen to minister (5-39)
Redemption of the firstborn (40-51)
```

### The Service of the Levites

from [workbook January-February 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-15-21-2021/The-Service-of-the-Levites/)

- Jehovah took the Levites in place of the firstborn males of Israel (Nu 3:11-13; it-2 683 ¶3)
- The Levites enjoyed precious privileges (Nu 3:25, 26, 31, 36, 37; it-2 241)
- The Levites cared for their full duties between 30 and 50 years of age (Nu 4:46-48; it-2 241)

The males in Aaron’s family performed priestly duties. The rest of the Levites assisted them. Likewise, in the Christian congregation today, some responsible men care for weighty spiritual concerns, while others care for necessary routine matters.

#### Firstborns numbers and redemption

There were 22,273 firstborn males by name from a month old and up in Israel (Nu 3:43). Yet Levi had only 22,000 males serving as priests. The 273 excess of the Levites (Nu 3:46) have to be bought in redemption. Price: 5 shekel (1 shekel is 20 gerah) per person. 273 x 5 = 1365 shekel. 1 shekel equals 11.4 g. Total weight: 15.5561 kg silver. Worth: 11360 USD (2023/07/03 0.7323 USD per gram). 5 shekels in 1990: $11 according to the Insight book - now $42.

## Numbers 4

```
Service of the Kohathites (1-20)
Service of the Gershonites (21-28)
Service of the Merarites (29-33)
Summary of the census (34-49)
```

#### Nu 4:15​—What is one way to show fear of God? (w06 8/1 23 ¶13)

Experiencing Jehovah’s help during distress deepened David’s fear of God and strengthened his confidence in him. (Psalm 31:22-24) On three notable occasions, however, David’s fear of God lapsed, which led to serious consequences. The first involved his arranging for the ark of Jehovah’s covenant to be transported to Jerusalem on a wagon rather than on the shoulders of the Levites, as God’s Law directed. When Uzzah, who was leading the wagon, grabbed hold of the Ark  to steady it, he died on the spot for his “irreverent act.” Yes, Uzzah sinned seriously, yet ultimately, it was David’s failure to maintain proper respect for God’s Law that brought about that tragic outcome. Fearing God means doing things according to his arrangement.​—2 Samuel 6:2-9; Numbers 4:15; 7:9.

#### Census result

Family of Gershon 2,630 male 30 to 50 years old, Merari 3,200 people and Kohatites 2,750 for a total of 8,580 registered Levites for the temple service. That is 39% of the total census for Levites with 22,000 in 1512 BCE (Nu 3:39) and 23,000 in 1483 BCE for all Levites from one month and older. Firstborns in Israel: 23,273 (Nu 3:43) and 300 firstborn in Levi.

## Numbers 5

```
Quarantine of the unclean (1-4)
Confession and compensation (5-10)
Water test for suspected adultery (11-31)
```


## Numbers 6

```
Vow of Naziriteship (1-21)
Priestly blessing (22-27)
```

#### Nu 6:6, 7​—How could Samson touch dead bodies that he had slain and still remain a Nazirite? (w05 1/15 30 ¶2)

Samson, though, was a Nazirite in a different sense. Before Samson’s birth, Jehovah’s angel told his mother: “Look! you will be pregnant, and you will certainly give birth to a son, and no razor should come upon his head, because a Nazirite of God is what the child will become on leaving the belly; and he it is who will take the lead in saving Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.” (Judges 13:5) Samson took no vow of Naziriteship. He was a Nazirite by divine appointment, and his Naziriteship was for life. The restriction against touching a corpse could not apply in his case. If it did and he accidentally touched a dead body, how could he start over a lifelong Naziriteship that began with his birth? Evidently, then, the requirements for lifetime Nazirites differed in some ways from those for voluntary Nazirites.

### How Can You Imitate the Nazirites?

from [workbook January-February 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-22-28-2021/How-Can-You-Imitate-the-Nazirites/)

- Nazirites practiced self-denial (Nu 6:2-4; it-2 477)
- Nazirites were submissive to Jehovah’s will (Nu 6:5)
- Nazirites remained clean before Jehovah (Nu 6:6, 7)

Full-time servants today show a spirit of self-sacrifice and submission to Jehovah and his arrangements.

## Numbers 7

```
Tabernacle inauguration offerings (1-89)
```

### Lessons From the Camp of Israel

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-1-7-2021/Lessons-From-the-Camp-of-Israel/)

- Appointed men take the lead in sacred service (Nu 7:10; it-1 497 ¶3)
- God’s servants should be well-organized and orderly (Nu 7:11; it-2 796 ¶1)
- Jehovah considers the limitations of individuals (Nu 8:25, 26; w04 8/1 25 ¶1)

Just as Jehovah organized Israel, he has organized his people today. However, he still sees each one of us and takes note of our individual efforts to serve him.

## Numbers 8

```
Aaron lights the seven lamps (1-4)
Levites cleansed, begin to serve (5-22)
Age restrictions for Levitical service (23-26)
```

#### Nu 8:17​—How did Jehovah consider the firstborn males in Israel? (it-1 835)

Since the firstborn sons among the Israelites were those in line to become the heads of the various households, they represented the entire nation. Jehovah, in fact, referred to the whole nation as his “firstborn,” it being his firstborn nation because of the Abrahamic covenant. (Ex 4:22) In view of his having preserved their lives, Jehovah commanded that “every male firstborn that opens each womb among the sons of Israel, among men and beasts,” be sanctified to him. (Ex 13:2) Thus, the firstborn sons were devoted to God.

## Numbers 9

```
Provision for late Passover (1-14)
Cloud and fire above the tabernacle (15-23)
```

#### Nu 9:13​—What lesson can Christians learn from this direction to Israel? (it-1 199 ¶3)

**Importance of Assembling.** The importance of taking full advantage of Jehovah’s provisions for assembling to gain spiritual benefits is emphasized in connection with the annual Passover observance. Any male who was clean and was not on a journey but who neglected to keep the Passover was to be cut off in death. (Nu 9:9-14) When King Hezekiah called inhabitants of Judah and Israel to Jerusalem for a Passover celebration, his message was, in part: “You sons of Israel, return to Jehovah . . . do not stiffen your neck as your forefathers did. Give place to Jehovah and come to his sanctuary that he has sanctified to time indefinite and serve Jehovah your God, that his burning anger may turn back from you. . . . Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and he will not turn away the face from you if you return to him.” (2Ch 30:6-9) Willful failure to attend would certainly have indicated a forsaking of God. And, while such festivals as the Passover are not observed by Christians, Paul fittingly urged them not to abandon regular assemblies of God’s people, stating: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.”​—Heb 10:24, 25; see CONGREGATION.

### How Jehovah Leads His People

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-8-14-2021/How-Jehovah-Leads-His-People/)

- Jehovah decided where his people should go and when (Nu 9:17, 18; it-1 398 ¶3)
- Those in the camp needed to obey promptly (Nu 9:21, 22; w11 4/15 4-5)
- Jehovah used imperfect human representatives to give direction (Nu 10:5-8)

When we obey those taking the lead, we demonstrate obedience to Jehovah.

## Numbers 10

```
The silver trumpets (1-10)
Departure from Sinai (11-13)
Order of marching (14-28)
Hobab asked to guide Israel (29-34)
Moses’ prayer when breaking camp (35, 36)
```


## Numbers 11

```
Complaining brings fire from God (1-3)
People cry for meat (4-9)
Moses’ feelings of inadequacy (10-15)
Jehovah gives spirit to 70 elders (16-25)
Eldad and Medad; Joshua jealous for Moses (26-30)
Quail sent; people punished for greed (31-35)
```

#### Nu 11:7, 8​—How did the appearance and taste of the manna demonstrate Jehovah’s goodness? (it-2 309)

Manna was “white like coriander seed” and had the “look” of bdellium gum, a waxlike and transparent substance having a form that resembles a pearl. Its taste was comparable to “that of flat cakes with honey” or “an oiled sweet cake.” After being ground in a hand mill or pounded in a mortar, manna was boiled or made into cakes and baked.​—Ex 16:23, 31; Nu 11:7, 8.

### Why Avoid a Complaining Spirit?

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-15-21-2021/Why-Avoid-a-Complaining-Spirit/)

- A complaining spirit displeases Jehovah (Nu 11:1; w01 6/15 17 ¶20)
- A complaining spirit demonstrates selfishness and a lack of appreciation (Nu 11:4-6; w06 7/15 15 ¶7)
- A complaining spirit discourages others (Nu 11:10-15; it-2 719 ¶4)

Although the Israelites experienced many hardships in the wilderness, they still had much to be thankful for. If we regularly count our blessings, we will be less inclined to complain.

## Numbers 12

```
Miriam and Aaron oppose Moses (1-3)
  Moses the meekest of all (3)
Jehovah defends Moses (4-8)
Miriam struck with leprosy (9-16)
```


## Numbers 13

```
The 12 spies sent into Canaan (1-24)
Bad report from ten spies (25-33)
```

####  Nu 13:27​—What did the spies report that should have strengthened Israel’s faith in Jehovah? (Le 20:24; it-1 740)

**THE land that God gave to Israel** was indeed a good land. When Moses sent spies ahead of the nation to explore the Promised Land and to obtain samples of its produce, they brought back figs, pomegranates, and a cluster of grapes that was so large that two men carried it between them on a bar! Though they drew back in fear because of lack of faith, they did report: The land “is indeed flowing with milk and honey.”​—Nu 13:23, 27.

Just before they finally entered the land, Jehovah’s spokesman assured the people: “Jehovah your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of torrent valleys of water, springs and watery deeps issuing forth in the valley plain and in the mountainous region, a land of wheat and barley and vines and figs and pomegranates, a land of oil olives and honey . . . in which you will lack nothing, a land the stones of which are iron and out of the mountains of which you will mine copper.” (De 8:7-9) To this day, the land continues to yield abundantly.

The beauty and splendor of that ancient land of promise is of keen interest to us today. Why? Because Messianic prophecies use the abundance with which Jehovah blessed ancient Israel to illustrate what God will do for all mankind under the rule of Jesus Christ, the “Prince of Peace.”​—Isa 9:6; Ps 67:4-7; 72:16.

### How Faith Makes Us Courageous

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-22-28-2021/How-Faith-Makes-Us-Courageous/)

- The spies who gave a bad report lacked faith (Nu 13:31-33; 14:11)
- The lack of faith of the ten spies disheartened their brothers (Nu 14:1-4)
- The spies who maintained courage had strong faith (Nu 14:6-9; w06 10/1 16-17 ¶5-6)

The Israelites had already witnessed Jehovah’s saving acts in their behalf. This should have strengthened their faith that he would help them conquer Canaan.

## Numbers 14

```
People want to return to Egypt (1-10)
  Joshua and Caleb’s good report (6-9)
Jehovah angry; Moses intercedes (11-19)
Punishment: 40 years in the wilderness (20-38)
Israel defeated by the Amalekites (39-45)
```


## Numbers 15

```
Laws about offerings (1-21)
  Same law for natives and foreign residents (15, 16)
Offerings for unintentional sins (22-29)
Punishment for deliberate sins (30, 31)
A Sabbathbreaker put to death (32-36)
Garments to have fringed edges (37-41)
```

#### Nu 15:32-35​—What lesson does this account teach? (w98 9/1 20 ¶1-2)

Jehovah viewed the case more seriously. “In time,” the Bible states, “Jehovah said to Moses: ‘Without fail the man should be put to death.’” (Numbers 15:35) Why did Jehovah feel so strongly about what the man did?

The people had six days to gather wood as well as to handle their needs regarding food, clothing, and shelter. The seventh day was to be devoted to their spiritual needs. While it was not wrong to gather wood, it was wrong to use time that should have been set aside to worship Jehovah to do so. Although Christians are not under the Mosaic Law, does this incident not teach us a lesson in properly setting our priorities today?—Philippians 1:10.

## Numbers 16

```
Rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram (1-19)
Judgment on the rebels (20-50)
```

### Beware of Pride and Overconfidence

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-29-April-4-2021/Beware-of-Pride-and-Overconfidence/)

- Korah rebelled against Jehovah’s arrangement because he became proud and overconfident (Nu 16:1-3; w11 9/15 27 ¶12)
- Korah was a respected Levite who already enjoyed many privileges (Nu 16:8-10; w11 9/15 27 ¶11)
- Korah’s wrong thinking had dire consequences (Nu 16:32, 35)

We must not allow our achievements in Jehovah’s service to cause us to develop pride and overconfidence. The longer we have been in the truth or the weightier our responsibilities, the more humble we need to be.

## Numbers 17

```
Aaron’s budded rod a sign (1-13)
```


## Numbers 18

```
Duties of priests and Levites (1-7)
Priestly allowances (8-19)
  Covenant of salt (19)
Levites to receive and to give a tenth (20-32)
```

#### Nu 18:19​—What is the meaning of the expression “a lasting covenant of salt”? (g02 6/8 14 ¶2)

Salt also became a symbol of stability and permanence. Therefore, in the Bible a binding covenant was called “a covenant of salt,” the parties often eating a meal together, with salt, to seal it. (Numbers 18:19) Under Mosaic Law, salt was to be added to sacrifices offered on the altar, doubtless denoting freedom from corruption or decay.

### “I Am . . . Your Inheritance”

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-5-11-2021/I-Am-Your-Inheritance/)

- Jehovah gave the priests and the Levites a priceless privilege of service (Nu 18:6, 7)
- The tribe of Levi received no land allotment but had Jehovah as their inheritance (Nu 18:20, 24; w11 9/15 13 ¶9)
- The nation gave a tenth of its produce to support the Levites and the priesthood (Nu 18:21, 26, 27; w11 9/15 7 ¶4)

Jehovah promised the priests and the Levites that he would care for their basic material needs. We can be confident that Jehovah will support us if we make sacrifices to serve him.

## Numbers 19

```
The red cow and the cleansing water (1-22)
```


## Numbers 20

```
Miriam dies at Kadesh (1)
Moses strikes the rock and sins (2-13)
Edom denies Israel passage (14-21)
The death of Aaron (22-29)
```

#### Nu 20:23-27​—What lessons can we learn from the way that Aaron reacted to discipline and from the way that Jehovah viewed him despite his mistakes? (w14 6/15 26 ¶12)

In each of these situations, Jehovah could have punished Aaron on the spot. But He discerned that Aaron was not a bad person or gravely at fault. It seems that Aaron allowed circumstances or the influence of others to turn him away from the right course. Yet, when he was confronted with his own mistakes, he readily admitted them and supported Jehovah’s judgments. (Ex. 32:26; Num. 12:11; 20:23-27) Jehovah chose to focus on Aaron’s faith and repentant attitude. Centuries later, Aaron and his descendants were still remembered as fearers of Jehovah.—Ps. 115:10-12; 135:19, 20.

### Maintain Your Meekness When Under Pressure

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-12-18-2021/Maintain-Your-Meekness-When-Under-Pressure/)

- Moses’ meekness was put to the test when he experienced pressure and stress (Nu 20:2-5; w19.02 12 ¶19)
- Moses temporarily lost his meekness (Nu 20:10; w19.02 13 ¶20-21)
- Jehovah disciplined Moses and Aaron for their serious mistake (Nu 20:12; w09 9/1 19 ¶5)

Meekness is a mildness of temper, without haughtiness or vanity. It enables one to endure injury with patience and without irritation, resentment, or retaliation.

## Numbers 21

```
King of Arad defeated (1-3)
Copper serpent (4-9)
Israel’s march around Moab (10-20)
Amorite King Sihon defeated (21-30)
Amorite King Og defeated (31-35)
```


## Numbers 22

```
Balak hires Balaam (1-21)
Balaam’s donkey speaks (22-41)
```

#### Nu 22:20-22​—Why did Jehovah’s anger blaze against Balaam? (w04 8/1 27 ¶2)

Jehovah had told the prophet Balaam that he should not curse the Israelites. (Numbers 22:12) However, the prophet went with Balak’s men with the full intention of cursing Israel. Balaam wanted to please the Moabite king and receive a reward from him. (2 Peter 2:15, 16; Jude 11) Even when Balaam was forced to bless rather than curse Israel, he sought the king’s favor by suggesting that Baal-worshiping women be used to seduce Israelite men. (Numbers 31:15, 16) Thus, the reason for God’s anger against Balaam was the prophet’s unscrupulous greed.

### Jehovah Turns a Curse Into a Blessing

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-19-25-2021/Jehovah-Turns-a-Curse-Into-a-Blessing/)

- The Moabites sought to harm the Israelites (Nu 22:3-6)
- Jehovah acted in behalf of his people (Nu 22:12, 34, 35; 23:11, 12)
- No one can successfully oppose Jehovah (Nu 24:12, 13; bt 53 ¶5; it-2 291)

Nothing, including persecution or disasters, can prevent the good news from being preached according to God’s will. When we experience personal hardships, do we rely on our heavenly Father and keep his worship our priority?

### Can One Person Make a Difference?

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-26-May-2-2021/Can-One-Person-Make-a-Difference/)

- Israel was lured into wrongdoing by Moab (Nu 25:1, 2; lvs 118 ¶1-2)
- Israel’s disloyalty and selfishness brought Jehovah’s rage (Nu 25:3-5; lvs 119 ¶4)
- Jehovah turned away his wrath because of one person’s decisive act of courage (Nu 25:6-11)

ASK YOURSELF, ‘In what situations do I need courage to stand out as different?’

## Numbers 26

```
Second census of Israel’s tribes (1-65)
```

#### Nu 26:55, 56​—How did Jehovah demonstrate wisdom when distributing the land inheritance among the tribes? (it-1 359 ¶1-2)

It thus appears that the distribution of the land among the tribes was governed by two factors: the result of the casting of the lot, and the size of the tribe. The lot may have established only the approximate location of the land inheritance each tribe would have, thus designating an inheritance in one section or another of the land, such as to the N or S, E or W, along the coastal plain, or in the mountainous region. The decision of the lot proceeded from Jehovah and hence would serve to prevent jealousy or quarreling among the tribes. (Pr 16:33) By this means God would also guide matters so that the situation of each tribe would fall in accordance with the inspired deathbed prophecy of the patriarch Jacob recorded at Genesis 49:1-33.

After the casting of the lot had determined the geographic location of a tribe, it would then be necessary to determine the extent of its territory on the basis of the second factor: its proportionate size. “You must apportion the land to yourselves as a possession by lot according to your families. To the populous one you should increase his inheritance, and to the sparse one you should reduce his inheritance. To where the lot will come out for him, there it will become his.” (Nu 33:54) The decision of the lot as to the basic geographic location would stand, but adjustment could be made as to the size of the inheritance. Thus, when Judah’s territory was found to be too large, its land area was reduced by assigning portions of it to the tribe of Simeon.​—Jos 19:9.
