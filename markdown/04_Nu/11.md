#### Nu 11:7, 8​—How did the appearance and taste of the manna demonstrate Jehovah’s goodness? (it-2 309)

Manna was “white like coriander seed” and had the “look” of bdellium gum, a waxlike and transparent substance having a form that resembles a pearl. Its taste was comparable to “that of flat cakes with honey” or “an oiled sweet cake.” After being ground in a hand mill or pounded in a mortar, manna was boiled or made into cakes and baked.​—Ex 16:23, 31; Nu 11:7, 8.

### Why Avoid a Complaining Spirit?

from [workbook March-April 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-15-21-2021/Why-Avoid-a-Complaining-Spirit/)

- A complaining spirit displeases Jehovah (Nu 11:1; w01 6/15 17 ¶20)
- A complaining spirit demonstrates selfishness and a lack of appreciation (Nu 11:4-6; w06 7/15 15 ¶7)
- A complaining spirit discourages others (Nu 11:10-15; it-2 719 ¶4)

Although the Israelites experienced many hardships in the wilderness, they still had much to be thankful for. If we regularly count our blessings, we will be less inclined to complain.
