## Numbers 6

```
Vow of Naziriteship (1-21)
Priestly blessing (22-27)
```

#### Nu 6:6, 7​—How could Samson touch dead bodies that he had slain and still remain a Nazirite? (w05 1/15 30 ¶2)

Samson, though, was a Nazirite in a different sense. Before Samson’s birth, Jehovah’s angel told his mother: “Look! you will be pregnant, and you will certainly give birth to a son, and no razor should come upon his head, because a Nazirite of God is what the child will become on leaving the belly; and he it is who will take the lead in saving Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.” (Judges 13:5) Samson took no vow of Naziriteship. He was a Nazirite by divine appointment, and his Naziriteship was for life. The restriction against touching a corpse could not apply in his case. If it did and he accidentally touched a dead body, how could he start over a lifelong Naziriteship that began with his birth? Evidently, then, the requirements for lifetime Nazirites differed in some ways from those for voluntary Nazirites.

### How Can You Imitate the Nazirites?

- Nazirites practiced self-denial (Nu 6:2-4; it-2 477)
- Nazirites were submissive to Jehovah’s will (Nu 6:5)
- Nazirites remained clean before Jehovah (Nu 6:6, 7)

Full-time servants today show a spirit of self-sacrifice and submission to Jehovah and his arrangements.
