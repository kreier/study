## Ezra 10

```
Covenant to send away foreign wives (1-14)
Foreign wives dismissed (15-44)
```

#### Ezr 10:3—Why were the children sent away along with the wives? (w06 1/15 20 ¶2)

 If the children had stayed behind, the likelihood that the dismissed wives would return on account of them would have increased. Moreover, little children generally require the care of their mother.
