## Judges 6

```
Midian oppresses Israel (1-10)
An angel assures Judge Gideon of support (11-24)
Gideon tears down altar of Baal (25-32)
God’s spirit active on Gideon (33-35)
The fleece test (36-40)
```

#### Jg 6:27​—How can Gideon’s example help us in the ministry? (w05 1/15 26 ¶6)

Gideon used discretion so as not to anger his opposers needlessly. When preaching the good news, we must be careful not to offend others unduly by the way we speak.

### “Go With the Strength You Have”

from [workbook November–December 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-6-12-2021/Go-With-the-Strength-You-Have/)

- Jehovah gave Gideon a daunting assignment (Jg 6:2-6, 14)
- Gideon felt unqualified and unworthy (Jg 6:15; w02 2/15 6-7)
- Gideon was successful because of Jehovah’s strength (Jg 7:19-22; w05 7/15 16 ¶3)

Jehovah expects us to use the strength we have to worship him. His holy spirit can make up for any lack and give us success.​—Isa 40:30, 31.
