```

#### Jg 16:1-3​—How are we to understand these verses? (w05 3/15 27 ¶6)

Samson was single-minded in the pursuit of his objective, his fight against the Philistines. His staying at the house of a prostitute at Gaza was for the purpose of fighting against God’s enemies. Samson needed a lodging place for the night in an enemy city, and it could be found in the house of a prostitute. Samson had no immoral purpose in mind. He left the woman’s house at midnight, grabbed the city gates and the two side posts, and carried them to the top of a mountain near Hebron, which was some 37 miles **[60 km]** away. This was done with divine approval and God-given strength.​—Judges 16:1-3.

### Betrayal—How Contemptible!

Delilah was tempted to betray Samson for money (Jg 16:4, 5; w12 4/15 8 ¶4)

Delilah nagged Samson until he revealed his secret (Jg 16:15-18; w05 1/15 27 ¶5)

Christians must show loyalty in the family and in the congregation (1Th 2:10; w12 4/15 11-12 ¶15-16)

Jehovah rewards those who remain loyal.​—Ps 18:25, 26.
