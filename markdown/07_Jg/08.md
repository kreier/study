#### Jg 8:27​—Did Gideon worship the ephod that he made? (it-1 753 ¶1)

In spite of Gideon’s good intentions to commemorate the victory Jehovah had given Israel and to honor God, the ephod “served as a snare to Gideon and to his household,” because the Israelites committed spiritual immorality by worshiping it. (Jg 8:27) However, the Bible does not say that Gideon himself worshiped it; on the contrary, he is specifically named by the apostle Paul as one of the ‘great cloud’ of faithful pre-Christian witnesses of Jehovah.​—Heb 11:32; 12:1.

- Humility helped Gideon to promote peace (Jg 8:1-3; w00 8/15 25 ¶3)
- Humility caused Gideon to seek Jehovah’s glory rather than his own (Jg 8:22, 23; w17.01 20 ¶15)
- Pride resulted in Abimelech bringing harm upon himself and others (Jg 9:1, 2, 5, 22-24; w08 2/15 9 ¶9)
