## Judges 5

```
Victory song of Deborah and Barak (1-31)
  Stars fight against Sisera (20)
  Torrent of Kishon floods (21)
  Those loving Jehovah are like the sun (31)
```

#### Jg 5:20​—How did the stars fight from the heavens in behalf of Barak? (w05 1/15 25 ¶5)

The Bible does not say whether this involved angelic assistance, meteorite showers that were interpreted ominously by Sisera’s wise men, or perhaps astrological predictions for Sisera that proved false. Undoubtedly, however, there was some type of divine intervention.
