## Judges 4

```
Canaanite King Jabin oppresses Israel (1-3)
Prophetess Deborah and Judge Barak (4-16)
Jael kills army chief Sisera (17-24)
```

**4:8**​—*Why did Barak insist that the prophetess Deborah go with him to the battlefield?* Evidently, Barak felt inadequate to go up against Sisera’s army by himself. Having the prophetess with him would reassure him and his men that they had God’s guidance and would give them confidence. Barak’s insistence that Deborah accompany him, then, was not a sign of weakness but of strong faith.
