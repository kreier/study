## Judges 2

```
Warning from Jehovah’s angel (1-5)
Death of Joshua (6-10)
Judges raised up to save Israel (11-23)
```

#### Jg 2:10-12​—How is this a warning example for us? (w05 1/15 24 ¶7)

We must have a regular program  of Bible study so as ‘not to forget Jehovah’s doings.’ (Psalm 103:2) Parents need to sound down the truth of God’s Word into the hearts of their children.​—Deuteronomy 6:6-9.

**2:14, 21, 22.** Jehovah allows bad things to happen to his disobedient people for a purpose​—to chastise them, to refine them, and to move them to return to him.
