# Genesis

Written by Moses in the wildernis. The writing was completed 1513 B.C.E. The time covered is from "In the beginning" to 1657 B.C.E.

## Genesis 1

```
Creation of heavens and earth (1, 2)
Six days of preparing the earth (3-31)
  Day 1: light; day and night (3-5)
  Day 2: expanse (6-8)
  Day 3: dry land and vegetation (9-13)
  Day 4: heavenly luminaries (14-19)
  Day 5: fish and birds (20-23)
  Day 6: land animals and humans (24-31)
```

Ge 1:1 ​— *What does the Bible say about the age of the earth?* (w15 6/1 5)

When God said on Day One, "Let light come to be," diffused light evidently penetrated the cloud layers even though the sources of that light could not yet be discerned from the earth’s surface. It seems that this was a gradual process, as is indicated by translator J. W. Watts: "And gradually light came into existence." (Ge 1:3, A Distinctive Translation of Genesis) God brought about a division between the light and the darkness, calling the light Day and the darkness Night. This indicates that the earth was rotating on its axis as it revolved around the sun, so that its hemispheres, eastern and western, could enjoy periods of light and darkness.​—Ge 1:3, 4.

Ge 1:26 ​— *Was Jesus a co-Creator?* (it-2 52)

## Genesis 2

```
God rests on the seventh day (1-3)
Jehovah God, Maker of heaven and earth (4)
Man and woman in the garden of Eden (5-25)
  Man formed out of dust (7)
  Forbidden tree of knowledge (15-17)
  Creation of woman (18-25)
```

## Genesis 3

```
Origin of man’s sin (1-13)
  The first lie (4, 5)
Jehovah’s judgment on the rebels (14-24)
  Woman’s offspring foretold (15)
  Expulsion from Eden (23, 24)
```

### The Devastating Consequences of the First Lie

3:1-6, 15-19 from workbook January 2020

Satan has been misleading humans ever since he lied to Eve. (Re 12:9) How do the following lies that are promoted by Satan hinder people from drawing close to Jehovah?

- There is no all-powerful divine being
- God is a mysterious Trinity
- God does not have a name
- God torments people forever in a burning hell
- Everything that happens is God’s will
- God does not care about humans

## Genesis 4

```
Cain and Abel (1-16)
Cain’s descendants (17-24)
Seth and his son Enosh (25, 26)
```

Ge 4:23, 24 ​— *Why did Lamech compose this poem?* (it-2 192 ¶5)

The poem that Lamech composed for his wives (Ge 4:23, 24) reflects the violent spirit of that day. Lamech's poem ran: "Hear my voice, you wives of Lamech; give ear to my saying: A man I have killed for wounding me, yes, a young man for giving me a blow. If seven times Cain is to be avenged, then Lamech seventy times and seven." Evidently Lamech was presenting a case of self-defense, pleading that his act was not one of deliberate murder, like that of Cain. Lamech claimed that, in defending himself, he had killed the man who struck and wounded him. Therefore, his poem stood as a plea for immunity against anyone desiring to get revenge against him for killing his attacker.

Ge 4:26 ​— *In what way apparently did people in Enosh’s day begin "calling on the name of Jehovah"?* (it-1 338 ¶2)

## Genesis 5

```
From Adam to Noah (1-32)
  Adam fathered sons and daughters (4)
  Enoch walked with God (21-24)
```

Expanded timelines on paper have been used to visualize events in the flow of time for a long time. Creating one yourself will immerse you into the details and relations between events even further. I started a digital project in 2002 and got to this point:

God proclaims the coming of the Flood (17-22)
```

### "He Did Just So"

6:9, 13-16, 22 from workbook 2020

Imagine how much effort was required for Noah and his family to build the ark without modern tools and construction methods.

- The structure was enormous​—about 437 feet (133 m) long, 73 feet (22 m) wide, and 44 feet (13 m) tall
- Trees had to be cut, hewn, and lifted into place
- Both the inside and outside of the massive structure had to be covered with tar
- A one year’s supply of food had to be stockpiled for Noah’s family and the animals
- The project likely took 40 to 50 years to complete

## Genesis 7

```
Entering the ark (1-10)
The global Flood (11-24)
```

Ge 7:2 ​— *What evidently was the basis for the distinction between clean and unclean animals?* (w04 1/1 29 ¶7)

The basis of distinction evidently pertained to the use of sacrifices in worship and not to what could and could not be eaten. Animal flesh was not a part of man’s diet prior to the Flood. The designations "clean" and "unclean" for food came into existence only with the Mosaic Law, and they ended when it was abolished. (Acts 10:9-16; Ephesians 2:15) Apparently, Noah knew what was suitable for sacrifice in the worship of Jehovah. As soon as he left the ark, he "began to build an altar to Jehovah and to take some of all the clean beasts and of all the clean flying creatures and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar."​—Genesis 8:20.

Ge 7:11​ — *Where apparently did the water that caused the global Flood come from?* (w04 1/1 30 ¶1)

During the second creative period, or "day", when the earth’s atmospheric "expanse" was formed, there were waters "beneath the expanse" and waters "above the expanse." (Genesis 1:6, 7) The waters "beneath" were those already on earth. The waters "above" were huge quantities of moisture suspended high above the earth, forming a "vast watery deep." These waters fell upon the earth in Noah’s day.

## Genesis 8

```
The floodwaters subside (1-14)
  Dove sent out (8-12)
Leaving the ark (15-19)
God’s promise for the earth (20-22)
```

## Genesis 9

```
Instructions for all mankind (1-7)
  Law about blood (4-6)
Rainbow covenant (8-17)
Prophecies about Noah’s descendants (18-29)
```

#### Ge 9:20-22, 24, 25 ​— *Why might Noah have cursed Canaan instead of Ham?* (it-1 1023 ¶4)

It is possible that Canaan himself had been involved directly in the incident and that his father Ham had failed to correct him. Or Noah, speaking prophetically by inspiration, foresaw that the bad tendency in Ham, perhaps already manifest in his son Canaan, would be inherited by Canaan’s offspring. The curse was partly fulfilled when the Semitic Israelites subjugated the Canaanites. Those who were not destroyed (for example, the Gibeonites [Jos 9]) were made slaves to Israel. Centuries later, the curse was further fulfilled when descendants of Ham’s son Canaan came under the domination of the Japhetic world powers of Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome.

#### Ge 10:9, 10 ​— *How was Nimrod "a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah"?* (it-2 503)

The beginning of Nimrod’s kingdom included the cities of Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, all in the land of Shinar. (Ge 10:10) Therefore it was likely under his direction that the building of Babel and its tower began. This conclusion is also in agreement with the traditional Jewish view. Wrote Josephus: "[Nimrod] little by little transformed the state of affairs into a tyranny, holding that the only way to detach men from the fear of God was by making them continuously dependent upon his own power. He threatened to have his revenge on God if He wished to inundate the earth again; for he would build a tower higher than the water could reach and avenge the destruction of their forefathers. The people were eager to follow this advice of [Nimrod], deeming it slavery to submit to God; so they set out to build the tower . . . and it rose with a speed beyond all expectation." ​— Jewish Antiquities, I, 114, 115 (iv, 2, 3).

  Descendants of Japheth (2-5)
  Descendants of Ham (6-20)

```

```

### "All the Earth Continued to Be of One Language"

**11:1-4, 6-9** from workbook January 2020

At Babel, Jehovah scattered disobedient humans by confusing their language. Today he is gathering a great crowd out of all nations and tongues and giving them "a pure language" so that they "may call on the name of Jehovah, to serve him shoulder to shoulder." (Zep 3:9; Re 7:9) This "pure language" is the truth about Jehovah and his purposes as found in the Scriptures.

Learning a new language takes more than just memorizing new words. It requires learning a new way of thinking, new thought patterns. Similarly, as we learn the pure language of truth, our minds are transformed. (Ro 12:2) This is a continuing process that results in unity among God’s people.​—1Co 1:10.


## Genesis 12

```
Abram leaves Haran for Canaan (1-9)
  God’s promise to Abram (7)
Abram and Sarai in Egypt (10-20)
```

## Genesis 13

```
Abram returns to Canaan (1-4)
Abram and Lot separate (5-13)
God’s promise to Abram repeated (14-18)
```

Ge 13:8, 9 ​— *How can we imitate Abraham when resolving disputes?* (w16.05 5 ¶12)

A Scriptural account in which God’s servants peacefully resolved a potentially divisive issue is the one mentioned earlier involving Abraham and his nephew Lot. Both men possessed livestock, and their shepherds apparently quarreled about grazing land. Eager to eliminate tensions, Abraham offered Lot first choice of the areas where their respective households would settle. (Gen. 13:1, 2, 5-9) What a good example! Abraham sought peace, not his own interests. Did he lose out because of his generosity? Not at all. Immediately after this incident with Lot, Jehovah promised Abraham great blessings. (Gen. 13:14-17) God will never allow his servants to suffer lasting loss for acting in harmony with divine principles and settling differences in a spirit of love

## Genesis 14

```
Abram rescues Lot (1-16)
Melchizedek blesses Abram (17-24)
```

Ge 14:18-20​—How did Levi pay "tithes through Abraham"? (Heb 7:4-10; it-2 683 ¶1)

Melchizedek king of Salem was a priest (ko·henʹ) extraordinary. The Bible gives no record of his ancestry, his birth, or his death. His priesthood was not by inheritance, and he had no predecessors or successors in office. Melchizedek held both the office of king and of priest. His priesthood was greater than the Levitical priesthood, for Levi, in effect, paid tithes to Melchizedek, since he was still in the loins of Abraham when Abraham offered tithes to Melchizedek and was blessed by him. (Ge 14:18-20; Heb 7:4-10) In these things Melchizedek foreshadowed Jesus Christ, the "priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek."​—Heb 7:17.
