# Deuteronomy

Written by Moses in the plains of Moab. The writing was completed 1473 B.C.E. The time covered is two months in 1473 B.C.E.

## Deuteronomy 1

```
Leaving Mount Horeb (1-8)
Chiefs and judges appointed (9-18)
Disobedience at Kadesh-barnea (19-46)
  Israel’s refusal to enter the land (26-33)
  Unsuccessful conquest of Canaan (41-46)
```

#### De 1:19; 2:7​—How did Jehovah care for his people during their 40-year trek through a “great and fearsome wilderness”? (w13 9/15 9 ¶9)

When the Israelites set out on what became a 40-year trek through a “fear-inspiring wilderness,” Jehovah did not give them specific details beforehand as to how he would direct, protect, and care for them. Still, he repeatedly demonstrated that they could trust in him and his instructions. Using a pillar of cloud by day and one of fire by night, Jehovah reminded the Israelites that he was backing them as he led them across that inhospitable terrain. (Deut. 1:19; Ex. 40:36-38) He also provided for their basic needs. “Their very garments did not wear out, and their feet themselves did not become swollen.” Indeed, “they lacked nothing.”—Neh. 9:19-21.

### “The Judgment Belongs to God”

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-May-31-June-6-2021/The-Judgment-Belongs-to-God/)

- Elders must “judge with righteousness” (De 1:16; w96 3/15 23 ¶1)
- Elders “must not be partial in judgment” (De 1:17; w02 8/1 9 ¶4)

How can we all show that we appreciate the elder arrangement?​—Heb 13:17; Jas 5:13-15

## Deuteronomy 2

```
Wandering in the wilderness for 38 years (1-23)
Victory over King Sihon of Heshbon (24-37)
```

**2:4-6, 9, 19, 24, 31-35; 3:1-6**​—Why did the Israelites annihilate some of the people who lived east of the Jordan but not others? Jehovah commanded Israel not to engage in strife with the sons of Esau. Why? Because they were the offspring of Jacob’s brother. The Israelites were not to molest or war against the Moabites and the Ammonites, for they were descendants of Abraham’s nephew Lot. However, the Amorite Kings Sihon and Og had no such claims to the land under their control. Hence, when Sihon refused to let the Israelites pass through and Og came to meet them in battle, Jehovah commanded the Israelites to demolish their cities, leaving no survivors. (from [w20040915](https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/w20040915/Highlights-From-the-Book-of-Deuteronomy/#p12))

## Deuteronomy 3

#### De 4:23​—What was the point of this prohibition? (w04 9/15 25 ¶3)

**Does the prohibition against making carved images mean that it is wrong to make representations of objects for artistic purposes?** No. The prohibition here was against making images for worship​—against ‘bowing down to idols and serving them.’ The Scriptures do not forbid carving sculptures or making paintings of objects for artistic purposes.​—1 Kings 7:18, 25.

### Jehovah’s Laws Are Wise and Just

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-7-13-2021/Jehovahs-Laws-Are-Wise-and-Just/)

- We show wisdom and understanding when we obey God’s laws (De 4:6; it-2 1140 ¶5)
- Many who observe our actions recognize the wisdom of God’s laws (De 4:6; w99 11/1 20 ¶6-7)
- Jehovah’s people enjoy a way of life far superior to that of the nations (De 4:7, 8; w07 8/1 29 ¶13)

Many people are drawn to Jehovah’s organization when they see the fine conduct of those who live by God’s laws and principles.

## Deuteronomy 5

```
Jehovah’s covenant at Horeb (1-5)
The Ten Commandments restated (6-22)
The people’s fear at Mount Sinai (23-33)
```

#### De 5:21​—What does the law against covetousness teach us? (w19.02 22 ¶11)

Jehovah sees beyond a person’s outward appearance. He sees what we really are inside, in our heart. (1 Sam. 16:7) No thought, no feeling, no action can be kept secret from him. He looks for and encourages the good in us. But he wants us to identify and control wrong thoughts before they become wrong actions.​—2 Chron. 16:9; Matt. 5:27-30.

## Deuteronomy 6

  “Listen, O Israel” (4)
  Parents to instruct children (6, 7)
Do not forget Jehovah (10-15)
Do not put Jehovah to the test (16-19)
Tell the next generation (20-25)
```

### Train Your Children to Love Jehovah

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-14-20-2021/Train-Your-Children-to-Love-Jehovah/)

- Parents must cultivate their own love for Jehovah (De 6:5; w05 6/15 20 ¶11)
- They must set a good example for their children (De 6:6; w07 5/15 15-16)
- They must teach their children often about Jehovah (De 6:7; w05 6/15 21 ¶14)

## Deuteronomy 7

```

### “You Must Not Form Any Marriage Alliances With Them”

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-21-27-2021/You-Must-Not-Form-Any-Marriage-Alliances-With-Them/)

- Jehovah required the Israelites to marry only fellow believers (De 7:3; w12 7/1 29 ¶2)
- Jehovah wants his servants to avoid pain and heartache (De 7:4; w15 3/15 30-31)
- Jehovah’s viewpoint regarding marriage has not changed (1Co 7:39; 2Co 6:14; w15 8/15 26 ¶12)

**ASK YOURSELF**, ‘How does the requirement to marry “only in the Lord” benefit me?’

## Deuteronomy 8

```
Blessings from Jehovah reviewed (1-9)
  “Not live by bread alone” (3)
Do not forget Jehovah (10-20)
```

#### De 8:3​—What can we learn from Jehovah’s provision of the manna? (w04 2/1 13 ¶4)

Our prayer for daily bread should also remind us of our need for daily spiritual food. Although very hungry after a long fast, Jesus resisted Satan’s temptation to turn stones into bread, saying: “It is written, ‘Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.’” (Matthew 4:4) Jesus here quoted the prophet Moses, who told the Israelites:  “[Jehovah] humbled you and let you go hungry and fed you with the manna, which neither you had known nor your fathers had known; in order to make you know that not by bread alone does man live but by every expression of Jehovah’s mouth does man live.” (Deuteronomy 8:3) The way in which Jehovah supplied the manna provided the Israelites not only with physical food but also with spiritual lessons. For one thing, they were to “pick up each his amount day for day.” If they gathered more than enough for the day, the remainder began to smell and breed worms. (Exodus 16:4, 20) Yet, this did not occur on the sixth day when they had to gather double the daily amount to cover their needs for the Sabbath. (Exodus 16:5, 23, 24) So the manna impressed upon their minds that they had to be obedient and that their lives depended not just on bread but on “every expression of Jehovah’s mouth.”

## Deuteronomy 9

```
Why Israel was given the land (1-6)
Israel provokes Jehovah four times (7-29)
  The golden calf (7-14)
  Moses intercedes (15-21, 25-29)
  Three more provocations (22)
```

#### De 9:1-3​—Although the sons of Anak were “great and tall,” why did the Israelites have no need to fear them? (it-1 103)

(Anʹa·kim) [Those of (Belonging to) Anak].

A race of people of extraordinary size who inhabited the mountainous regions of Canaan as well as some coastal areas, particularly in the S thereof. At one time three prominent men of the Anakim, that is, Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, resided at Hebron. (Nu 13:22) It was here that the 12 Hebrew spies first saw the Anakim, and 10 of the spies subsequently gave a frightening report of the experience, alleging that these men were descendants of the pre-Flood Nephilim and that, by comparison with them, the Hebrews were like “grasshoppers.” (Nu 13:28-33; De 1:28) Their great stature caused them to be used as a standard of comparison in describing even the giantlike men of the Emim and the Rephaim. Their strength apparently produced the proverbial saying: “Who can make a firm stand before the sons of Anak?”​—De 2:10, 11, 20, 21; 9:1-3.

## Deuteronomy 10

```
Two tablets remade (1-11)
What Jehovah requires (12-22)
  Fear and love Jehovah (12)
```

### “What Is Jehovah Your God Asking of You?”

from [workbook May-June 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-28-July-4-2021/What-Is-Jehovah-Your-God-Asking-of-You/)

- Obedience leads to blessings (De 10:13; w09 10/1 10 ¶6)
- Jehovah wants us to draw close to him (De 10:15; cl 16 ¶2)

Jehovah does not force us to obey him. Rather, he wants us to love and obey him “from the heart.” (Ro 6:17) Those who choose to serve Jehovah enjoy the best way of life.
