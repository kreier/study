### Open Your Heart to Jehovah in Prayer

from [workbook January–February 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-7-13-2022/Open-Your-Heart-to-Jehovah-in-Prayer/)

- Hannah prayed at length to Jehovah (1Sa 1:10, 12, 15; ia 55 ¶12)
- Hannah left her problems in Jehovah’s hands (1Sa 1:18; w07 3/15 16 ¶4)
- When we pour out our heart before Jehovah, we can trust that he will strengthen and sustain us.​—Ps 55:22; 62:8.

## 1 Samuel 2

```
Hannah’s prayer (1-11)
Sins of Eli’s two sons (12-26)
Jehovah judges the house of Eli (27-36)
```

#### 1Sa 2:10​—Why did Hannah pray that Jehovah “give power to his king” when there was no human king over Israel? (w05 3/15 21 ¶5)

That the Israelites would have a human king was foretold in the Mosaic Law. (Deuteronomy 17:14-18) In his deathbed prophecy, Jacob said: “The scepter [a symbol of royal authority] will not turn aside from Judah.” (Genesis 49:10) Moreover, concerning Sarah​—the ancestress of the Israelites—​Jehovah said: “Kings of peoples will come from her.” (Genesis 17:16) Hannah, then, was praying about a future king.

## 1 Samuel 3

```
Samuel called to be a prophet (1-21)
```

#### 1Sa 3:3​—How do we know that Samuel did not sleep in the Most Holy? (w05 3/15 21 ¶6)

Samuel was a Levite of the nonpriestly family of the Kohathites. (1 Chronicles 6:33-38) As such, he was not permitted to “come in to see the holy things.” (Numbers 4:17-20) The only part of the sanctuary that Samuel had access to was the tabernacle courtyard. That is where he must have slept. Apparently, Eli also slept  somewhere in the courtyard. The expression “where the ark of God was” evidently refers to the tabernacle area.

### Jehovah Is Considerate

from [workbook January–February 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-14-20-2022/Jehovah-Is-Considerate/)

- Samuel thought that Eli was calling him (1Sa 3:4-7; w18.09 24 ¶3)
- Jehovah made it clear that He was calling Samuel (1Sa 3:8, 9)
- Jehovah showed kind consideration for young Samuel (1Sa 3:15-18; w18.09 24 ¶4)

**ASK YOURSELF:** ‘In what ways can I show consideration for younger ones and older ones? How can I show consideration for others at Christian meetings?’

#### 1Sa 7:3​—What does this verse teach us about conversion and repentance? (w02 4/1 12 ¶13)

Conversion must take place prior to our baptism as Witnesses of Jehovah. Conversion is a voluntary act performed freely by one who has made a wholehearted decision to follow Christ Jesus. Such individuals reject their former wrong course and determine to do what is right in God’s sight. In the Scriptures, Hebrew and Greek verbs pertaining to conversion have the sense of turning back, turning around. This action denotes a turning to God from a wrong way. (1 Kings 8:33, 34) Conversion calls for “works that befit repentance.” (Acts 26:20) It requires that we abandon false worship, act in harmony with God’s commandments, and render exclusive devotion to Jehovah. (Deuteronomy 30:2, 8-10; 1 Samuel 7:3) Conversion results in changes in our thinking, objectives, and disposition. (Ezekiel 18:31) We “turn around” as ungodly traits are replaced by the new personality.​—Acts 3:19; Ephesians 4:20-24; Colossians 3:5-14.

## 1 Samuel 8

```
Israel demands a king (1-9)
Samuel warns the people (10-18)
Jehovah grants the request for a king (19-22)
```

### Who Is Your King?

from [workbook January–February 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-21-27-2022/Who-Is-Your-King/)

- The Israelites presumptuously requested a human king (1Sa 8:4, 5; it-2 163 ¶1)
- The Israelites were not content to have Jehovah as their invisible Ruler (1Sa 8:7, 8; w11 1/1 27 ¶1)
- Jehovah warned them of the consequences of their request (1Sa 8:9, 18; w10 1/15 30 ¶9)

Jehovah has always exercised his sovereignty over all his creation. His rulership is kind and dignifies his subjects. Our obeying and supporting his rulership will result in eternal blessings.

## 1 Samuel 9

```
Samuel meets with Saul (1-27)
```

#### 1Sa 9:9​—What might these words have signified? (w05 3/15 22 ¶8)

**What is significant about the expression “the prophet of today used to be called a seer in former times”?** These words may indicate that as the prophets became more prominent in the days of Samuel and during the era of the kings in Israel, the word “seer” came to be replaced by the term “prophet.” Samuel is considered the first of the line of the prophets.​—Acts 3:24.

## 1 Samuel 10

```
Saul anointed to be king (1-16)
Saul presented to the people (17-27)
```

### Saul Started Out Humble and Modest

from [workbook January–February 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/january-february-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-February-28-March-6-2022/Saul-Started-Out-Humble-and-Modest/)

- Saul was modest and hesitated to accept the kingship (1Sa 9:21; 10:20-22; w20.08 10 ¶11)
- Saul did not act rashly when others spoke negatively of him (1Sa 10:27; 11:12, 13; w14 3/15 9 ¶8)
- Saul responded to the leadings of Jehovah’s holy spirit (1Sa 11:5-7; w95 12/15 10 ¶1)

Humility will help us to view our privileges and abilities as gifts from Jehovah. (Ro 12:3, 16; 1Co 4:7) Also, if we are humble, we will continue to rely on Jehovah for guidance.
