### Do You Learn From Your Mistakes?

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-1-7-2022/Do-You-Learn-From-Your-Mistakes/)

- Adonijah was shown mercy after ambitiously scheming to become king (1Ki 1:5, 52, 53; it-2 987 ¶4)
- Adonijah did not learn from his mistake and suffered the consequences (1Ki 2:15-17, 22, 23; it-1 49)

A wise person will learn from his mistakes. Even better, he will learn from the mistakes of others.​—1Co 10:11.

## 1 Kings 2

```
David instructs Solomon (1-9)
David dies; Solomon on the throne (10-12)
Adonijah’s plot leads to his death (13-25)
Abiathar banished; Joab killed (26-35)
Shimei killed (36-46)
```

#### 1Ki 2:37, 41-46​—What lesson can we learn from the mistake of Shimei? (w05 7/1 30 ¶1)

How dangerous it is to think that one can step out of bounds with impunity! Those who deliberately deviate from following ‘the cramped road leading off into life’ will suffer the consequences of that unwise decision.​—Matthew 7:14.

## 1 Kings 3

```
Solomon marries Pharaoh’s daughter (1-3)
Jehovah appears to Solomon in a dream (4-15)
  Solomon asks for wisdom (7-9)
Solomon judges between two mothers (16-28)
```

### The Value of Wisdom

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-8-14-2022/The-Value-of-Wisdom/)

- Solomon asked Jehovah for wisdom (1Ki 3:7-9; w11 12/15 8 ¶4-6)
- Solomon’s request pleased Jehovah (1Ki 3:10-13)
- Because Solomon valued godly wisdom, the nation lived in security (1Ki 4:25)

A wise person combines knowledge with understanding and puts them to work in a practical way. Wisdom is more valuable than gold. (Pr 16:16) We can acquire wisdom by asking God for it, fearing him, being humble and modest, and digging into his Word.

## 1 Kings 4

```
Solomon’s administration (1-19)
Prosperity under Solomon’s rule (20-28)
  Security under vine and fig tree (25)
Solomon’s wisdom and proverbs (29-34)
```

#### 1Ki 4:20​—What is significant about the expression “as numerous as the grains of sand by the sea”? (w98 2/1 11 ¶15)

With Abraham’s descendants organized as a nation under the Law, Jehovah blessed them according to his promise to the patriarch. In 1473 B.C.E., Moses’ successor, Joshua, led Israel into Canaan. The subsequent division of the land among the tribes fulfilled Jehovah’s promise to give the land to Abraham’s seed. When Israel was faithful, Jehovah fulfilled his promise to give them victory over their enemies. This was especially true during the rule of King David. By the time of David’s son Solomon, a third aspect of the Abrahamic covenant was fulfilled. “Judah and Israel were many, like the grains of sand that are by the sea for multitude, eating and drinking and rejoicing.”—1 Kings 4:20.

## 1 Kings 5

```
King Hiram provides building materials (1-12)
Solomon’s conscripted workforce (13-18)
```

### Built With Their Hands and Their Hearts

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-15-21-2022/Built-With-Their-Hands-and-Their-Hearts/)

- Solomon used the best building materials for the temple (1Ki 5:6, 17; w11 2/1 15)
- Many shared in the work (1Ki 5:13-16; it-1 424; it-2 1077 ¶1)
- Solomon and the people worked hard for seven years to complete the project (1Ki 6:38; see cover picture)

Solomon and the people were able to build a beautiful temple to Jehovah’s praise because their hearts were in the work. Sadly, enthusiasm for Jehovah’s worship faded with future generations. They allowed the temple to fall into disrepair, and eventually it was destroyed.

## 1 Kings 6

```
Solomon builds the temple (1-38)
  Innermost room (19-22)
  Cherubs (23-28)
  Engravings, doors, inner courtyard (29-36)
  Temple completed in about seven years (37, 38)
```

#### 1Ki 6:1​—What does this verse illustrate about the Bible? (g 5/12 17, box)

An example of the value of the Bible’s precise timekeeping is demonstrated at 1 Kings 6:1, which points to the time when King Solomon commenced work on the temple in Jerusalem. We read: *“It came about in the four hundred and eightieth year [479 full years] after the sons of Israel came out from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year [of Solomon’s reign], in the month of Ziv, that is, the second month, after Solomon became king over Israel, that he proceeded to build the house to Jehovah.”*

Bible chronology places the fourth year of Solomon’s reign at 1034 B.C.E. Counting back from that date 479 full years brings us to 1513 B.C.E. as the year of Israel’s Exodus.

## 1 Kings 7

```
Solomon’s palace complex (1-12)
Skilled Hiram to assist Solomon (13-47)
  The two copper pillars (15-22)
  The Sea of cast metal (23-26)
  Ten carriages and basins of copper (27-39)
Furnishings of gold completed (48-51)
```

#### 1Ki 7:23​—What lesson can we learn from the large “Sea of cast metal” that was constructed for the temple? (it-1 263)

Physical cleanliness is required of those who worship Jehovah in holiness and purity. This was demonstrated in connection with the tabernacle arrangement and the later temple service. At their installation, High Priest Aaron and his sons bathed before donning the official garments. (Ex 29:4-9; 40:12-15; Le 8:6, 7) To wash their hands and feet, the priests used water from the copper basin in the courtyard of the tabernacle and, later, from the huge molten sea at Solomon’s temple. (Ex 30:18-21; 40:30-32; 2Ch 4:2-6) On the Day of Atonement the high priest bathed twice. (Le 16:4, 23, 24) Those who took the goat for Azazel, the remains of the animal sacrifices, and the sacrificial red cow outside the camp had to bathe their flesh and wash their garments before reentering the camp.​—Le 16:26-28; Nu 19:2-10.

### What We Can Learn From Two Pillars

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-22-28-2022/What-We-Can-Learn-From-Two-Pillars/)

- Two conspicuous pillars were built for the porch of the temple (1Ki 7:15, 16; w13 12/1 13 ¶3)
- The pillars were given meaningful names (1Ki 7:21; it-1 348)
- Jehovah would help the people “firmly establish” the temple as long as they relied on him (1Ki 7:21, ftn.; Ps 127:1)

Jehovah may have helped us to overcome many obstacles in order to come into the truth. But we must continue to rely on him in order to “stand firm in the faith.”​—1Co 16:13.

## 1 Kings 8

```
The Ark brought into the temple (1-13)
Solomon addresses the people (14-21)
Solomon’s prayer of temple dedication (22-53)
Solomon blesses the people (54-61)
Sacrifices and dedication festival (62-66)
```

#### 1Ki 8:27​—What does Solomon’s statement not mean? (it-1 1060 ¶4)

Solomon, the constructor of the temple at Jerusalem, stated that the “heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens” cannot contain God. (1Ki 8:27) As the Creator of the heavens, Jehovah’s position is far above them all, and “his name alone is unreachably high. His dignity is above earth and heaven.” (Ps 148:13) Jehovah measures the physical heavens as easily as a man would measure an object by spreading his fingers so that the object lies between the tips of the thumb and the little finger. (Isa 40:12) Solomon’s statement does not mean that God has no specific place of residence. Nor does it mean that he is omnipresent in the sense of being literally everywhere and in everything. This can be seen from the fact that Solomon also spoke of Jehovah as hearing “from the heavens, your established place of dwelling,” that is, the heavens of the spirit realm.​—1Ki 8:30, 39.

### Solomon’s Humble, Heartfelt Public Prayer

from [workbook July–August 2022](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2022-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-29-September-4-2022/Solomons-Humble-Heartfelt-Public-Prayer/)

- At the temple inauguration, Solomon offered a heartfelt prayer in front of the people (1Ki 8:22; w09 11/15 9 ¶9-10)
- Solomon praised Jehovah and did not draw attention to himself (1Ki 8:23, 24)
- Solomon prayed with a humble spirit (1Ki 8:27; w99 1/15 17 ¶7-8)

Solomon provides a good example, especially for those who pray publicly. We should focus more on how we sound to Jehovah than on how we sound to people.
