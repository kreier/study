The burnt offering (1-17)
```

### The Purpose of Offerings

**1:3; 2:1, 12; 3:1** from [workbook November 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-9-15-2020/The-Purpose-of-Offerings/)

The offerings, or sacrifices, commanded under the Law covenant pleased Jehovah and pointed to Jesus and the ransom sacrifice or to the benefits from that sacrifice.​—Heb 8:3-5; 9:9; 10:5-10.

- Just as all animals to be sacrificed were to be sound and unblemished, Jesus sacrificed his perfect, unblemished body.​—1Pe 1:18, 19
- Just as burnt offerings were presented in their entirety to God, Jesus gave himself wholly to Jehovah
- Just as those who offered an acceptable communion sacrifice were at peace with God, the anointed who share in the Lord’s Evening Meal are at peace with God

### Regulations for sacrifices (1:1–7:38)

The various sacrifices fall into two general categories (from [si](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/All-Scripture-Is-Inspired-of-God-and-Beneficial/Bible-Book-Number-3-Leviticus/) 1990): 

- *blood*, cattle, sheep, goats, and fowl
- *bloodless*, consisting of grain

The **blood** sacrifices are to be offered as either 

1) burnt
2) communion
3) sin
4) guilt offerings

All four have these three things in common: 

- The offerer must himself bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting.
- He must lay his hands upon it.
- The animal is to be slaughtered.

## Leviticus 2

```
The grain offering (1-16)
```

#### Le 2:13​—Why did salt have to be presented with every offering? (Eze 43:24; w04 5/15 22 ¶1)

This was not done to enhance the flavor of the sacrifices. Around the world, salt is used as a preservative. It was likely presented with offerings because it represents freedom from corruption and decay.

## Leviticus 3

```
The communion offering (1-17)
  Do not eat fat or blood (17)
```

#### Le 3:17​—Why were the Israelites prohibited from eating fat, and what lesson does this teach? (it-1 813; w04 5/15 22 ¶2)

Since the fat was regarded as the best or the richest part, the prohibition against eating it evidently impressed upon the Israelites that the best part belonged to Jehovah. (Genesis 45:18) This reminds us that we should give our very best to Jehovah.​—Proverbs 3:9, 10; Colossians 3:23, 24.

## Leviticus 4

The sin offering (1-35)
```


## Leviticus 5

```
Specific sins and required offerings (1-6)
  Reporting sins of others (1)
Alternative offerings for the poor (7-13)
The guilt offering for unintentional sins (14-19)
```

#### Le 5:1​—How does this verse apply to Christians? (w16.02 30 ¶14)

Kindness can help you to deal with a conflict of loyalties. For example, you may have definite knowledge that a certain fellow believer is guilty of serious misconduct. You may feel loyal to him, especially if he is a close friend or a relative. But if you were to cover up the wrongdoing, you would be disloyal to God. Of course, your loyalty to Jehovah should come first. So like Nathan, be kind yet firm. Urge your friend or relative to seek the help of the elders. If he or she does not do so within a reasonable period of time, loyalty to God should move you to report the matter to the elders. In doing this, you are being loyal to Jehovah and kind to your friend or relative, for Christian elders will try to readjust such an individual with mildness.​—Read Leviticus 5:1; Galatians 6:1.

#### Le 5:15, 16​—How might someone have ‘behaved unfaithfully by unintentionally sinning against the holy things of Jehovah’? (it-1 1130 ¶2)

The firstborn males of cattle, sheep, and goats were counted as holy to Jehovah and were not to be redeemed. They were to be sacrificed, and a portion went to the sanctified priests. (Nu 18:17-19) The firstfruits and the tithe were holy, as were all sacrifices and all gifts sanctified to the service of the sanctuary. (Ex 28:38) All things holy to Jehovah were sacred and could not be considered lightly or used in a common, or profane, way. An example is the law regarding the tithe. If a man set aside the portion to be tithed, say, of his wheat crop, and then he or one of his household unintentionally took some of it for home use, such as cooking, the man was guilty of violating God’s law respecting holy things. The Law required that he make compensation to the sanctuary of an equal amount plus 20 percent, besides offering up a sound ram of the flock as a sacrifice. Thus, great respect was engendered for the holy things belonging to Jehovah.​—Le 5:14-16.

### Give Jehovah Your Best

**5:5-7, 11** from [workbook November 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-16-22-2020/Give-Jehovah-Your-Best/)

Poverty denied no one in Israel the privilege of making peace with Jehovah. Even the poorest Israelites could give Jehovah an acceptable offering, as long as it was their best. They could offer flour, but Jehovah still expected it to be “fine,” the kind used for honored guests. (Ge 18:6) Today, Jehovah accepts our best “sacrifice of praise,” regardless of how much our personal circumstances may limit what we can give.​—Heb 13:15.

How can this encourage you if you cannot do all that you did before, perhaps because of declining health or stamina?

#### Le 6:13​—What is a traditional Jewish view of the origin of the fire on the altar, but what do the Scriptures indicate? ([it-1 833 ¶1 Fire](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/Insight-on-the-Scriptures/Fire/#p5))

Fire figured in the worship carried on at the tabernacle and then later at the temple. Each morning and between the two evenings, the high priest was to burn incense on the altar of incense. (Ex 30:7, 8) God’s law required that the fire on the altar of burnt offering be kept burning continually. (Le 6:12, 13) The traditional Jewish view that the altar fire was originally kindled miraculously by God, though widely accepted, is not actually supported by the Scriptures. According to Jehovah’s initial instructions to Moses, the sons of Aaron were to “put fire on the altar and set wood in order on the fire” before placing the sacrifice on the altar. (Le 1:7, 8) It was *after* the installation of the Aaronic priesthood, and therefore after the installation sacrifices had been offered, that fire from Jehovah, probably proceeding from the cloud over the tabernacle, consumed the offering then upon the altar. In view of this, the miraculous fire manifested itself, not in kindling the wood on the altar, but in “consuming the burnt offering and the fatty pieces upon the altar.” The fire that then continued to burn on the altar, of course, was likely a result of the mixture of the fire from God and the fire already on the altar. (Le 8:14–9:24) Likewise, miraculous fire from Jehovah consumed the sacrifices right after Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the temple.​—2Ch 7:1; see also Jg 6:21; 1Ki 18:21-39; 1Ch 21:26 for other examples of Jehovah’s use of miraculous fire when accepting the offerings of his servants.

#### Le 6:25​—How were sin offerings different from burnt offerings and communion offerings? (si 27 ¶15)

A sin offering is required for unintentional sins, or sins committed by mistake. The type of animal offered depends upon whose sin is being atoned for​—that of the priest, the people as a whole, a chieftain, or an ordinary person. Unlike the voluntary burnt and communion offerings for individuals, the sin offering is mandatory.​—4:1-35; 6:24-30.

### An Expression of Thanksgiving

**7:11-15, 20** from [workbook November 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-23-29-2020/An-Expression-of-Thanksgiving/)

Communion sacrifices in Israel remind us of the importance of expressing our appreciation to Jehovah in our prayers and by our conduct.​—Php 4:6, 7; Col 3:15.

- When we pray, what specific things can we thank Jehovah for?​—1Th 5:17, 18
- How does showing thankfulness benefit us?
- How might someone partake of “the table of demons,” and how would this show a lack of appreciation to Jehovah?​—1Co 10:20, 21

## Leviticus 8

```
Installation of the Aaronic priesthood (1-36)
```

#### Le 8:6​—What can we learn from the requirement that Israel’s priesthood be physically clean? (w14 11/15 9 ¶6)

The requirement that Israel’s priesthood be physically clean has real meaning for Jehovah’s people today. Those with whom we study the Bible often notice that our places of worship are clean and also how neat and well-dressed we are. Yet, the cleanness of the priesthood helps us to realize that anyone who ascends the elevated mountain of Jehovah’s worship must have “a pure heart.” (Read Psalm 24:3, 4; Isa. 2:2, 3.) Our sacred service to God must be rendered with cleansed minds and hearts as well as with clean bodies. This calls for frequent self-examination, after which some may need to make significant changes so that they can be holy. (2 Cor. 13:5) For instance, a baptized person who deliberately views pornography should ask himself, ‘Am I proving myself holy?’ Then he ought to get help to end that vile practice.—Jas. 5:14.

#### Le 8:14-17​—During the installation of the priesthood, why did Moses offer the sacrifices and not Aaron? (it-2 437 ¶3)

God constituted Moses mediator of the Law covenant with Israel, an intimate position such as no man has ever held before God except Jesus Christ, the Mediator of the new covenant. With the blood of animal sacrifices Moses sprinkled the book of the covenant, representing Jehovah as one “party,” and the people (no doubt the representative older men) as the other “party.” He read the book of the covenant to the people, who replied, “All that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do and be obedient.” (Ex 24:3-8; Heb 9:19) In his office of mediator, Moses was privileged to oversee the building of the tabernacle and the making of its utensils, the pattern of which God gave to him, and to install the priesthood in office, anointing the tabernacle and Aaron the high priest with the oil of special composition. Then he took oversight of the first official services of the newly consecrated priesthood.​—Ex chaps 25-29; Le chaps 8, 9.

## Leviticus 9

```
Aaron makes offerings (1-24)
```

### Evidence of Jehovah’s Blessing

**8:6-9, 12; 9:1-5, 23, 24** from [workbook November 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-30-December-6-2020/Evidence-of-Jehovahs-Blessing/)

Jehovah caused fire to consume the first burnt offering of the newly installed Aaronic priesthood. This demonstrated Jehovah’s support and approval of this arrangement. Jehovah thus encouraged the assembled nation of onlookers to give the priesthood its full support. Today, Jehovah is using the glorified Jesus Christ as the greater High Priest. (Heb 9:11, 12) In 1919, Jesus appointed a small group of anointed men as “the faithful and discreet slave.” (Mt 24:45) What evidence is there that the faithful slave has Jehovah’s blessing, support, and approval?

- Despite relentless persecution, the faithful slave has continued to supply spiritual food
- As prophesied, the good news is being preached “in all the inhabited earth.”​—Mt 24:14

## Leviticus 10

```
Fire from Jehovah kills Nadab and Abihu (1-7)
Regulations for priests regarding drinking and eating (8-20)
```

#### Le 10:8-11​—What can we learn from these verses? (w14 11/15 17 ¶18)

To be holy, we must weigh the Scriptures carefully and do what God asks of us. Consider Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu, who were executed for offering “unauthorized fire,” perhaps while inebriated. (Lev. 10:1, 2) Note what God then told Aaron. (Read Leviticus 10:8-11.) Does that passage mean that we must not drink anything alcoholic before going to a Christian meeting? Think about these points: We are not under the Law. (Rom. 10:4) In some lands, our fellow believers use alcoholic beverages *in moderation* at meals before attending meetings. Four cups of wine were used at the Passover. When instituting the Memorial, Jesus had his apostles drink wine that represented his blood. (Matt. 26:27) The Bible condemns heavy drinking and drunkenness. (1 Cor. 6:10; 1 Tim. 3:8) And many Christians would feel impelled by their conscience to abstain completely from alcoholic beverages before engaging in any form of sacred service. However, circumstances vary from one country to another, and the important thing is for Christians to “distinguish between the holy thing and the profane” so as to conduct themselves with holiness that pleases God.

### Love for Jehovah Stronger Than Love for Family

** 10:1, 2, 4-7** from [workbook December 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/december-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-7-13-2020/Love-for-Jehovah-Stronger-Than-Love-for-Family/)

*Nadab and Abihu carrying fire holders filled with burning incense.*

Our loyalty to Jehovah can be greatly tested when a loved one is disfellowshipped. Jehovah’s instruction to Aaron provides a clear message to those who must cut off association with a disfellowshipped relative. Our love for Jehovah must be stronger than our love for unfaithful family members.

What blessings can come to those who work along with Jehovah’s instructions regarding disfellowshipped ones?​—1Co 5:11; 2Jo 10, 11

## Leviticus 11

```
Clean and unclean animals (1-47)
```

#### Le 11:8​—Must Christians refuse to eat animals prohibited under the Mosaic Law? (it-1 111 ¶5)

These dietary limitations applied only to those who were under the Mosaic Law, for the statement of Leviticus 11:8 is: “They are unclean for you,” that is, for the Israelites. With the abrogation of the Law on the basis of the sacrificial death of Christ Jesus, the prohibitions were canceled, and once more all humans could consider themselves under the same broad provision announced to Noah following the Deluge.​—Col 2:13-17; Ge 9:3, 4.

## Leviticus 12

```
Purification after childbirth (1-8)
```

#### Le 12:2, 5​—Why did childbirth make a woman “unclean”? (w04 5/15 23 ¶2)

The reproductive organs were made to pass on perfect human life. However, because of the inherited effects of sin, imperfect and sinful life was passed on to the offspring. The temporary periods of ‘uncleanness’ associated with childbirth, as well as other matters, such as menstruation and seminal emissions, called this hereditary sinfulness to mind. (Leviticus 15:16-24; Psalm 51:5; Romans 5:12) The required purification regulations would help the Israelites to appreciate the need for a ransom sacrifice to cover mankind’s sinfulness and restore human perfection. Thus the Law became their “tutor leading to Christ.”​—Galatians 3:24.

#### Le 12:3​—Why might Jehovah have required circumcision on the eighth day? (wp18.1 7)

God’s Law stipulated that a male child should be circumcised on the eighth day of life. (Leviticus 12:3) In newborn babies, the blood’s ability to clot is understood to reach normal levels after the first week. In Bible times, before advanced medical treatments were available, waiting for over a week before circumcision was a wise protection.

### Learn From the Laws on Leprosy

**13:4, 5, 45, 46, 52, 57** from [workbook December 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/december-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-14-20-2020/Learn-From-the-Laws-on-Leprosy/)

What can the principles behind the laws on leprosy teach us about protecting our spiritual health?

- Jehovah taught the priests how to identify leprosy quickly. Christian shepherds today are quick to give attention to any who require spiritual assistance.​—Jas 5:14, 15
- Israelites had to destroy any items infected with leprosy to prevent further contamination. Christians too must be willing to give up even something precious to them rather than allowing it to lead them into sin. (Mt 18:8, 9) This may include such things as habits, associations, or entertainment

## Leviticus 14

```
Cleansing from leprosy (1-32)
Cleansing of infected houses (33-57)
```

#### Le 14:14, 17, 25, 28​—What can we learn from the purification procedure for a cleansed leper? (it-1 665 ¶5)

At the installation of the priesthood in Israel, Moses was commanded to take some of the blood of the ram of the installation and put it on the lobe of the right ear of Aaron and of each of his sons, as well as on the right hand and right foot, indicating that what they listened to, the work they did, and the way they walked should be directly affected by what was there taking place. (Le 8:22-24) Similarly, in the case of the cleansed leper, the Law said that the priest was to put some of the blood of the ram offered as a guilt offering, as well as some of the oil offered, on the lobe of the leper’s right ear. (Le 14:14, 17, 25, 28) An arrangement of comparable nature was found in the provision made for the man who wished to continue in slavery to his master to time indefinite. In such case the slave was to be brought to the doorpost, and his master was to pierce his ear through with an awl. This prominent mark, being made on the organ for hearing, evidently represented the slave’s desire to continue in obedient attention to his master.​—Ex 21:5, 6.

#### Le 14:43-45​—What did the law regarding malignant leprosy in a house teach the Israelites about Jehovah? (g 1/06 14, box)

The Bible mentions “the plague of leprosy in a house,” meaning in the building itself. (Leviticus 14:34-48) It has been suggested that this phenomenon, also called “malignant leprosy,” was a form of mildew or mold, but about this there is uncertainty. Whatever the case, God’s Law instructed homeowners to remove infected stones, scrape out the entire inside of the house, and discard all the suspect matter outside the city in “an unclean place.” If the plague returned, the whole house was to be declared unclean, pulled down, and disposed of. Jehovah’s detailed instructions reflected his deep love for his people and for their physical welfare.

## Leviticus 15

```
Unclean genital discharges (1-33)
```

### Pure Worship Requires Cleanness

**15:13-15, 28-31** from [workbook December 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/december-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-21-27-2020/Pure-Worship-Requires-Cleanness/)

To remain in God’s love, we need to be clean on the inside as well as on the outside. This means that we adhere faithfully to Jehovah’s standards of physical, moral, and spiritual cleanness, regardless of how the world around us acts. We refrain from touching anything that our heavenly Father views as unclean.

## Leviticus 16

```
The Day of Atonement (1-34)
```

#### Le 16:10​—In what ways did the goat for Azazel picture the sacrifice of Jesus? (it-1 226 ¶3)

As the apostle Paul explained, by Jesus’ offering of his own perfect human life as a sacrifice for the sins of mankind, he accomplished far more than had been achieved by “the blood of bulls and of goats.” (Heb 10:4, 11, 12) He thus served as “the scapegoat,” being the ‘carrier of our sicknesses,’ the one “pierced for our transgression.” (Isa 53:4, 5; Mt 8:17; 1Pe 2:24) He ‘carried away’ the sins of all who exercise faith in the value of his sacrifice. He demonstrated the provision of God to take sinfulness into complete oblivion. In these ways the goat “for Azazel” pictures the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

### Atonement Day and You

**16:12-15** from [workbook December 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/december-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-28-2020-January-3-2021/Atonement-Day-and-You/)

What can we learn from the use of incense on Atonement Day?

- The acceptable prayers of Jehovah’s faithful servants are like incense. (Ps 141:2) Just as the high priest brought the incense to Jehovah with great respect, we approach Jehovah in prayer with awe and respect
- The high priest had to burn incense before he could offer up the sacrifices. Similarly, before Jesus could offer up his life as a sacrifice, he had to prepare the way for Jehovah to accept his sacrifice by living a life of integrity and loyalty

## Leviticus 17

```

#### Le 17:10, 11​—Why do we refuse to accept a blood transfusion? (w14 11/15 10 ¶10)

Jehovah commanded the Israelites not to eat “any sort of blood.” Abstaining from blood—animal or human—is a Christian requirement as well. (Acts 15:28, 29) We shudder at the very thought of having God ‘set his face against us’ and cut us off from his congregation. We love him and want to obey him. Even when confronted with a life-threatening situation, we are determined not to cave in to the pleas and demands of those who do not know Jehovah and who do not care to obey him. Yes, we expect to be ridiculed for abstaining from blood, but we choose to be obedient to God. (Jude 17, 18) What view on this subject will strengthen us to “be firmly resolved” not to eat blood or accept a blood transfusion?—Deut. 12:23.
