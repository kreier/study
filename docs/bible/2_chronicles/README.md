# 2 Chronicles

Written by Ezra probably in Jerusalem. The writing was completed c. 460 B.C.E. The time covered is from 1037 to 537 B.C.E.

## 2 Chronicles 1

```
Solomon’s request for wisdom (1-12)
Solomon’s wealth (13-17)
```

#### 2Ch 1:11, 12​—What does this account teach us about our personal prayers? (w05 12/1 19 ¶6)

Solomon’s request showed Jehovah that gaining wisdom and knowledge was close to the king’s heart. Our prayers to God indeed reveal what is close to our heart. We are wise to analyze their content.

### King Solomon Makes an Unwise Decision

from [workbook March–April 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-20-26-2023/King-Solomon-Makes-an-Unwise-Decision/)

- Solomon accumulated horses and chariots from Egypt (De 17:15, 16; 2Ch 1:14, 17)
- People and cities were needed to accommodate Solomon’s new military divisions (2Ch 1:14; it-1 174 ¶5; 427)

Although the people prospered during a good part of Solomon’s reign, they revolted under King Rehoboam because he kept his father’s heavy burdens and added to them. (2Ch 10:3, 4, 14, 16) Our decisions always have consequences.​—Ga 6:7.

## 2 Chronicles 2

```
Preparations for building the temple (1-18)
```

## 2 Chronicles 3

  The Ark brought to the temple (2-10)
```

## 2 Chronicles 6

```
Solomon’s address to the people (1-11)
Solomon’s prayer of inauguration (12-42)
```

#### 2Ch 6:29, 30​—How can these words of Solomon’s prayer comfort us? (w10 12/1 11 ¶7)

We can draw comfort from Solomon’s prayer. Fellow humans may not fully understand our inner feelings​—our “own plague” and our “own pain.” (Proverbs 14:10) But Jehovah knows our heart, and he deeply cares about us. Pouring out our heart to him in prayer can make our burdens easier to bear. “Throw all your anxiety upon him,” says the Bible, “because he cares for you.”​—1 Peter 5:7.

## 2 Chronicles 7

```
Temple filled with Jehovah’s glory (1-3)
Inauguration ceremonies (4-10)
Jehovah appears to Solomon (11-22)
```

### “My Heart Will Always Be There”

from [workbook March–April 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-March-27-April-2-2023/My-Heart-Will-Always-Be-There/)

- Jehovah chose the temple for himself (2Ch 7:11, 12)
- Jehovah’s heart would always be there, indicating that he would be highly interested in what went on at this house associated with his name (2Ch 7:16; w02 11/15 5 ¶1)
- If the people stopped walking before Jehovah “with all their heart,” he would allow the temple to be destroyed (2Ch 6:14; 7:19-21; it-2 1077-1078)

At the time of the temple’s inauguration, the people likely thought their heart would always be at the temple. Sadly, the people gradually lost their enthusiasm for worshipping Jehovah.

## 2 Chronicles 8

```
Solomon’s other building projects (1-11)
Worship at the temple organized (12-16)
Solomon’s fleet (17, 18)
```

## 2 Chronicles 9

```

Death of Solomon (29-31)
```

#### 2Ch 9:19​—What may the 12 lion statues leading to Solomon’s throne have represented? (it-2 1097)

The only throne of a ruler of Israel described in detail is the one Solomon made. (1Ki 10:18-20; 2Ch 9:17-19) It appears to have been located in “the Porch of the Throne,” one of the buildings that stood on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. (1Ki 7:7) It was ‘a great ivory throne overlaid with refined gold with a round canopy behind it and armrests.’ Although ivory could have been the basic material in this royal chair, the construction technique generally followed at the temple would seem to indicate that it was made of wood, overlaid with refined gold and richly ornamented with inlaid panels of ivory. To the observer, such a throne would appear to be made entirely of ivory and gold. After mentioning six steps leading to the throne, the record continues: “Two lions were standing beside the armrests. And there were twelve lions standing there upon the six steps, on this side and on that side.” (2Ch 9:17-19) The symbolism of the lion denoting ruling authority is appropriate. (Ge 49:9, 10; Re 5:5) The 12 lions appear to have corresponded to the 12 tribes of Israel, possibly symbolizing their subjection to and support of the ruler on this throne. Attached in some way to the throne was a footstool of gold. By its description this ivory-and-gold throne​—in its lofty, canopied position with the majestic lions in front—​transcends any throne of that time period, whether discovered by archaeologists, depicted on the monuments, or described in the inscriptions. As the chronicler truthfully observed: “No other kingdom had any made just like it.”​—2Ch 9:19.

### She Valued Wisdom

from [workbook March–April 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-10-16-2023/She-Valued-Wisdom/)

- The queen of Sheba made a long and arduous trip to see Solomon (2Ch 9:1, 2; w99 11/1 20 ¶4; w99 7/1 30 ¶4-5)
- Solomon’s wisdom and riches left her breathless (2Ch 9:3, 4; w99 7/1 30-31; see cover picture)
- What she saw moved her to praise Jehovah (2Ch 9:7, 8; it-2 990-991)

The queen of Sheba valued wisdom so much that she was willing to make great sacrifices to obtain it.

## 2 Chronicles 10

```
Israel’s rebellion against Rehoboam (1-19)
```

### Benefit From Wise Advice

from [workbook March–April 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-17-23-2023/Benefit-From-Wise-Advice/)

- Rehoboam was faced with a decision (2Ch 10:1-4; w18.06 13 ¶3)
- Rehoboam sought advice (2Ch 10:6-11; w01 9/1 28-29)
- Rehoboam and the people suffered because he rejected wise advice (2Ch 10:12-16; it-2 768 ¶1)

Because of their experience, older, spiritually mature ones can often perceive how a situation will likely turn out.​—Job 12:12.

## 2 Chronicles 11

```
Rehoboam’s rule (1-12)
Loyal Levites move to Judah (13-17)
Rehoboam’s family (18-23)
```

#### 2Ch 11:15​—What may be indicated by the term “goatlike demons”? (it-1 966-967)

Joshua’s words at Joshua 24:14 show that the Israelites had been affected to some extent by the false worship of Egypt during their sojourn there, while Ezekiel indicates that such pagan practices continued to plague them long afterward. (Eze 23:8, 21) For this reason some scholars consider that the divine decree issued in the wilderness to prevent the Israelites from making “sacrifices to the goat-shaped demons” (Le 17:1-7) and Jeroboam’s establishing priests “for the high places and for the goat-shaped demons and for the calves that he had made” (2Ch 11:15) indicate there was some form of goat worship among the Israelites such as was prominent in Egypt, particularly in Lower Egypt. Herodotus  (II, 46) claims that from such Egyptian worship the Greeks derived their belief in Pan and also in the satyrs, woodland gods of a lustful nature, who were eventually depicted as having horns, a goat’s tail, and goat’s legs. Some suggest that such half-animal form of these pagan gods is the source of the practice of picturing Satan with tail, horns, and cloven feet, a custom prevalent among professed Christians in the Dark Ages.

Just what such “hairy ones” (*seʽi·rimʹ*) actually were, however, is not stated. While some consider them to be literal goats or idols in the form of goats, this does not necessarily seem to be indicated; nor do other scriptures provide evidence of that nature. The term used may simply indicate that *in the minds of those worshiping them* such false gods were conceived of as being goatlike in shape or hairy in appearance. Or, the use of “goats” in these references may be merely a means of expressing contempt for all idolatrous objects in general, even as the word for idols in numerous texts is drawn from a term originally meaning “dung pellets,” not denoting, however, that the idols were literally made of dung.​—Le 26:30; De 29:17.

### Rely On Jehovah—When?

from [workbook March–April 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/march-april-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-April-24-30-2023/Rely-On-Jehovah-When/)

- Asa relied on Jehovah to defeat a large army (2Ch 14:9-12; w21.03 5 ¶12)
- Asa later counted on the Syrians to defeat a smaller army (2Ch 16:1-3; w21.03 5 ¶13)
- Jehovah was displeased with Asa for not continuing to seek His help (2Ch 16:7-9)

We may rely on Jehovah when making life-altering decisions, but what about at other times? It is important to take notice of Jehovah in all our ways.​—Pr 3:5, 6; w21.03 6 ¶14.

## 2 Chronicles 15

```
Asa’s reforms (1-19)
```

#### 2Ch 15:16​—How can we imitate Asa’s courage? (w17.03 19 ¶7)

Each of us can examine his heart to see if it is fully devoted to God. Ask yourself, ‘Am I determined to please Jehovah, to defend true worship, and to protect his people from any corrupting influence?’ Think how much courage Asa had to muster to stand up to Maacah, who was “queen mother” in the land! You probably do not know anyone  who acts just like her, but there may be a situation in which you can imitate Asa’s zeal. For example, what if a member of your family or a close friend sins, is unrepentant, and has to be disfellowshipped? Would you take decisive action by ceasing to associate with that person? What would your heart move you to do?

## 2 Chronicles 16

```
Asa’s treaty with Syria (1-6)
Hanani rebukes Asa (7-10)
Death of Asa (11-14)
```

## 2 Chronicles 17

```
Jehoshaphat, king of Judah (1-6)
Teaching campaign (7-9)
Jehoshaphat’s military power (10-19)
```

#### 2Ch 17:9​—What can we learn from the teaching campaign that Jehoshaphat organized? (w17.03 20 ¶10-11)

Asa’s son Jehoshaphat “kept walking in the way of his father Asa.” (2 Chron. 20:31, 32) How so? Like his father, Jehoshaphat encouraged the people to search for Jehovah. He did so by organizing a teaching campaign that used “the book of Jehovah’s Law.” (2 Chron. 17:7-10) He even went to the territory of the northern kingdom of Israel, to the mountainous region of Ephraim, “to bring them back to Jehovah.” (2 Chron. 19:4) Jehoshaphat was a king “who searched for Jehovah with all his heart.”—2 Chron. 22:9.

We can all have a share in the great teaching campaign that Jehovah is having done today. Is it your goal each month to teach the Word of God to others, trying to move their heart to serve God? By your extending yourself and with God’s blessing, you may be able to start a Bible study. Is that a goal that you pray about? Are you willing to accept this challenge, even giving up some of what is commonly viewed as free time? And just as Jehoshaphat went to the territory of Ephraim to help people return to true worship, we can reach out to those who have become inactive. In addition, the congregation elders arrange to visit and offer help to disfellowshipped ones in the congregation territory who may have left their past practice of sin.

- King Jehoshaphat made an unwise alliance with King Ahab (2Ch 18:1-3; w17.03 24 ¶7)
- Jehovah sent Jehu to reprove Jehoshaphat (2Ch 19:1, 2)

### “Put Faith in Jehovah Your God”

from [workbook May–June 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-May-8-14-2023/Put-Faith-in-Jehovah-Your-God/)

- When threatened, Jehoshaphat and the people of Judah turned to Jehovah for help (2Ch 20:12, 13; w14 12/15 23 ¶8)
- Jehovah comforted his people and provided them with clear direction (2Ch 20:17)
- Jehovah saved his people because they put faith in him (2Ch 20:21, 22, 27; w21.11 16 ¶7)

When Gog attacks Jehovah’s people during the great tribulation, those who put faith in Jehovah and who trust those whom he is using to take the lead will have nothing to fear.​—2Ch 20:20.

## 2 Chronicles 21

```
Jehoram, king of Judah (1-11)
Written message from Elijah (12-15)
Jehoram’s bad end (16-20)
```

#### 2Ch 21:14, 15​—How was Elijah’s prophecy concerning Jehoram fulfilled? (it-1 1271 ¶1-2)

At least partially because of the bad influence of his wife Athaliah, Jehoram did not pursue the righteous ways of his father Jehoshaphat. (2Ki 8:18) Not only did Jehoram murder his six brothers and some of the princes of Judah but he also turned his subjects away from Jehovah to false gods. (2Ch 21:1-6, 11-14) His whole reign was marred by both internal trouble and external strife. First, Edom rebelled; then Libnah revolted against Judah. (2Ki 8:20-22) In a letter to Jehoram, the prophet Elijah warned: “Look! Jehovah is dealing a great blow to your people and to your sons and to your wives and to all your goods.” Moreover, you, King Jehoram, “will be with many sicknesses, with a malady of your intestines, until your intestines have come out because of the sickness day by day.”​—2Ch 21:12-15.

It all occurred just that way. Jehovah allowed Arabs and Philistines to overrun the land and take Jehoram’s wives and sons captive. God permitted only Jehoram’s youngest son, Jehoahaz (also called Ahaziah), to escape, a concession made, however, only for the sake of the Kingdom covenant made with David. “After all this Jehovah plagued [Jehoram] in his intestines with a sickness for which there was no healing.” Two years later “his intestines came out” and he gradually died. So ended the life of this wicked man, who “went away without being desired.” He was buried in the City of David, “but not in the burial places of the kings.” Ahaziah his son became king in his stead.​—2Ch 21:7, 16-20; 22:1; 1Ch 3:10, 11.

## 2 Chronicles 22

```
Ahaziah, king of Judah (1-9)
Athaliah usurps the throne (10-12)
```

### Jehovah Rewards Courageous Acts

from [workbook May–June 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-May-15-21-2023/Jehovah-Rewards-Courageous-Acts/)

- Jehoshabeath and her husband, Jehoiada, protected Jehoash from Athaliah (2Ch 22:11, 12; w09 4/1 24 ¶1-2)
- Jehoiada courageously took action to make Jehoash king (2Ch 23:1-11, 14, 15; w09 4/1 24 ¶3-5)
- Jehoiada was given the exceptional honor of being buried with the kings (2Ch 24:15, 16; it-1 379 ¶5)

**FOR MEDITATION:** In what areas of my worship would I like to show more courage?

## 2 Chronicles 23

```
Jehoiada intervenes; Jehoash made king (1-11)
Athaliah put to death (12-15)

Jehoash renovates the temple (4-14)
Jehoash’s apostasy (15-22)
Jehoash assassinated (23-27)
```

#### 2Ch 24:22​—How was Zechariah’s prophetic request fulfilled? (it-2 1223 ¶13)

Son of High Priest Jehoiada. After Jehoiada’s death, King Jehoash turned away from true worship, listening to wrong counsel rather than to Jehovah’s prophets. Zechariah, Jehoash’s cousin (2Ch 22:11), sternly warned the people about this, but instead of repenting, they stoned him in the temple courtyard. Zechariah’s dying words were: “Let Jehovah see to it and ask it back.” This prophetic request was granted, for not only did Syria do great damage to Judah but also Jehoash was killed by two of his servants “because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest.” The Greek *Septuagint* and the Latin *Vulgate* say that Jehoash was killed to avenge the blood of the “son” of Jehoiada. The Masoretic text and the Syriac *Peshitta*, however, read “sons,” possibly using the plural number to denote the excellence and worth of Jehoiada’s son Zechariah the prophet-priest.​—2Ch 24:17-22, 25.

## 2 Chronicles 25

```
Amaziah, king of Judah (1-4)
War with Edom (5-13)
Amaziah’s idolatry (14-16)

### “Jehovah Has the Means to Give You Much More Than That”

from [workbook May–June 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-May-22-28-2023/Jehovah-Has-the-Means-to-Give-You-Much-More-Than-That/)

- Amaziah hired mercenaries to fight against God’s enemies (2Ch 25:5, 6)
- A man of God advised Amaziah to dismiss the mercenaries (2Ch 25:7, 8; it-1 1266 ¶6)
- Jehovah could more than compensate Amaziah for any financial loss (2Ch 25:9, 10)

Uzziah, king of Judah (1-5)
Uzziah’s military exploits (6-15)
Haughty Uzziah made a leper (16-21)
Death of Uzziah (22, 23)
```

#### 2Ch 26:4, 5​—What does Uzziah’s example teach us about the value of having a spiritual mentor? (w07 12/15 10 ¶1-2)

AT THE tender age of 16, Uzziah became king of the southern kingdom of Judah. He reigned for over 50 years, from the late ninth to the early eighth century B.C.E. From a young age, Uzziah “kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes.” What influenced him to take an upright course? The historical record states: “[Uzziah] continually tended to search for God in the days of Zechariah, the instructor in the fear of the true God; and, in the days of his searching for Jehovah, the true God made him prosperous.”​—2 Chronicles 26:1, 4, 5.

Not much is known about Zechariah, the adviser to the king, apart from this account in the Bible. Yet, as “the instructor in the fear of the true God,” Zechariah exercised a fine influence on the young ruler to do what was right. *The Expositor’s Bible* observes that Zechariah was obviously “a man versed in sacred learning, rich in spiritual experience, and able to communicate his knowledge.” One Bible scholar concluded about Zechariah: “He was well versed in prophecy and . . . was an intelligent, devout, good man; and, it seems, had great influence with Uzziah.”

### You Can Serve Jehovah Despite a Difficult Upbringing

from [workbook May–June 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-May-29-June-4-2023/You-Can-Serve-Jehovah-Despite-a-Difficult-Upbringing/)

- Hezekiah’s father, King Ahaz, did detestable things (2Ch 28:1; w16.02 14 ¶8)
- Hezekiah chose to serve Jehovah despite his father’s bad example (2Ch 29:1-3; w16.02 14 ¶9-11)
- Hezekiah encouraged others not to let the unfaithfulness of their fathers stop them from serving Jehovah (2Ch 29:4-6)

## 2 Chronicles 29

```
Hezekiah, king of Judah (1, 2)
Hezekiah’s reforms (3-11)
Temple cleansed (12-19)
Temple services revived (20-36)
```

#### 2Ch 29:11—How did Hezekiah set a good example regarding priorities? (w13 11/15 17 ¶6-7)

Ahaz died in 746 B.C.E., and his son Hezekiah inherited the materially impoverished and spiritually bankrupt kingdom of Judah. As the young king ascended the throne, what would his priority be? To shore up Judah’s ailing economy? No. Hezekiah was a spiritual man, a worthy shepherd of his national flock. His first act was to reestablish pure worship and to reinforce the wayward nation’s frayed relationship with Jehovah. When he understood God’s will for him, Hezekiah acted decisively. What a fine example for us!—2 Chron. 29:1-19.

The Levites would play a vital role in the important task of restoring pure worship. Therefore, Hezekiah met with them to assure them of his support. Picture the faithful Levites who were present at that meeting, tears of joy streaming down their faces as they heard their king declare: “You are the ones whom Jehovah has chosen to stand before him to minister to him.” (2 Chron. 29:11) Yes, the Levites had a clear mandate to promote pure worship!


#### 2Ch 29:25​—What does Nathan’s example teach us about the benefits of accepting correction from Jehovah? (w12 2/15 24-25)

As a faithful worshipper of Jehovah, Nathan enthusiastically endorsed David’s plan to construct the first permanent center of pure worship on earth. On that occasion, however, Nathan apparently expressed his own feelings instead of speaking in Jehovah’s name. That night, God instructed his prophet to take a different message to the king: David would not build Jehovah’s temple. The person to do so would be one of David’s sons. But Nathan announced that God was making a covenant with David to the effect that his throne would become “firmly established to time indefinite.”​—2 Sam. 7:4-16.


### True Worship Requires Hard Work

## 2 Chronicles 30

```
Hezekiah observes the Passover (1-27)
```

#### 2Ch 30:20​—What can we learn from the way that Jehovah listened to Hezekiah? (w18.09 6 ¶14-15)

Another area that reveals the depth of our humility is our willingness to hear people out. James 1:19 says that we should “be quick to listen.” Jehovah himself sets the superlative example in this regard. (Gen. 18:32; Josh. 10:14) Consider what we can learn from the interchange recorded at Exodus 32:11-14. (Read.) Although not needing Moses’ input, Jehovah gave Moses an opportunity to reveal how he felt. What human would listen at length to the reasoning of someone who has displayed faulty thinking and then act on that person’s word? Yet, Jehovah listens patiently to humans who call on him in faith.

Each of us does well to ask: ‘If Jehovah can stoop down to deal with people and listen to them as he did with Abraham, Rachel, Moses, Joshua, Manoah, Elijah, and Hezekiah, should I not be better at honoring all my brothers, dignifying them, listening to their ideas, and even acting on their good ideas? Does someone in my congregation or in my family deserve my attention right now? What should I do about that? What will I do about that?’​—Gen. 30:6; Judg. 13:9; 1 Ki. 17:22; 2 Chron. 30:20.

Elders who are reading this article can draw some useful conclusions from the account we have just considered: (1) The most practical step that we can take to prepare for the coming attack of “the Assyrian” is that of strengthening our faith in God and helping our brothers to do the same. (2) When “the Assyrian” attacks, the elders must be absolutely convinced that Jehovah will deliver us. (3) At that time, the life-saving direction that we receive from Jehovah’s organization may not appear practical from a human standpoint. All of us must be ready to obey any instructions we may receive, whether these appear sound from a strategic or human standpoint or not. (4) Now is the time for any who may be putting their trust in secular education, material things, or human institutions to adjust their thinking. The elders must stand ready to help any who may now be wavering in their faith.

#### Timing of Manasseh's kingship

Ma·nasʹseh was 12 years old when he became king in 716 BCE and he reigned for 55 years until 661 BCE. He was 67 years old when he died (33:20) and his son Amon became king at the age of 22. He reigned only for 2 years from 661 to 659 BCE. Then his son Josiah became king at the age of 8 (34:1). So Josiah was 6 years old when his grandfather died, but he learned an important lesson from him. See "The Story of Josiah: Love Jehovah; Hate What Is Bad" from the 2019 regional convention "Love Never Fails".

#### 2Ch 33:11—What prophecy was fulfilled when Manasseh was taken to Babylon? (it-1 62 ¶2)

With regard to the “sixty-five years” at Isaiah 7:8, which Isaiah prophesied would be the period within which Ephraim would be “shattered to pieces,” the *Commentary on the Whole Bible* (by Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown) states: “*One* deportation of Israel happened within one or two years from this time [the time of Isaiah’s prophecy], under Tiglath-pileser (2 Kings 15. 29). *Another* in the reign of Hoshea, under Shalmaneser (2 Kings 17. 1-6), was about twenty years after. But the final one which utterly ‘broke’ up Israel so as to be ‘not a people,’ accompanied by a colonization of Samaria with foreigners, was under Esar-haddon, who carried away Manasseh, king of Judah, also, in the twenty-second year of his reign, sixty-five years from the utterance of this prophecy (cf. Ezra 4.2, 3, 10, with 2 Kings 17.24; 2 Chronicles 33.11).”

#### 2Ch 33:2-9, 12-16—On the basis of genuine repentance, Manasseh was shown mercy (w05 12/1 21 ¶5)

A person shows true repentance by abandoning a wrong course and putting forth a determined effort to do what is right. On the basis of genuine repentance, even a person who has acted as wickedly as King Manasseh can receive Jehovah’s mercy.

#### 2Ch 33:15, 16​—What can we learn from Manasseh’s example? (w21.10 4-5 ¶11-12)

In time, Jehovah answered Manasseh’s prayers. He saw the changes in that man’s heart, as reflected in his prayers. Jehovah was moved by Manasseh’s entreaty and restored him to the throne. Manasseh took full advantage of the opportunity to demonstrate the depth of his repentance. He did what Ahab had never done. He changed his conduct. He actively fought against false worship and promoted true worship. (Read 2 Chronicles 33:15, 16.) That surely required courage and faith, for Manasseh had been a bad influence on his family, his nobles, and his people for decades. But now, in his final years, Manasseh tried to undo some of the bad that he had done. Likely, he was a good influence on his young grandson Josiah, who later became a very good king.​—2 Ki. 22:1, 2.

What can we learn from Manasseh’s example? He humbled himself, and he did more. He prayed, begging for mercy. And he changed his course. He worked hard to undo the harm that he had caused, and he sought to worship Jehovah and to help others to do the same. Manasseh’s example gives hope to even the worst of sinners. We see powerful proof that Jehovah God is “good and ready to forgive.” (Ps. 86:5) Forgiveness is possible​—for those who are truly repentant.

### Are You Benefiting Fully From God’s Word?

from [workbook May–June 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/may-june-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-June-19-25-2023/Are-You-Benefiting-Fully-From-Gods-Word/)

Josiah listened to God’s Word carefully (2Ch 34:18, 19; see cover picture). He made an earnest effort to understand the meaning of what he was hearing (2Ch 34:21; it-1 1157 ¶4). 

When Josiah heard the reading of “the very book of the law” found by Hilkiah the high priest during the temple repair work, he sent a delegation to inquire of Jehovah. They went to Huldah, who, in turn, relayed the word of Jehovah, indicating that all the calamities for disobedience recorded in the “book” would befall the apostate nation. Huldah added that Josiah, because of having humbled himself before Jehovah, would not have to look upon the calamity but would be gathered to his forefathers and be taken to his graveyard in peace.​—2Ki 22:8-20; 2Ch 34:14-28.

He acted on what he learned (2Ch 34:33; w09 6/15 10 ¶20)

**ASK YOURSELF**, "Am I quick to act on what I learn about Jehovah in his Word, the Bible?" (from the workbook May-June 2023)

#### 2Ch 34:1-3—What encouragement can we draw from Josiah’s example? (w05 12/1 21 ¶6)

Any negative circumstances of childhood need not prevent us from coming to know God and serving him. A positive influence Josiah may have had during his early years could have come from his repentant grandfather, Manasseh. Whatever positive influences Josiah might have had eventually produced fine results. So it can be with us.

#### 2Ch 34:18, 30, 33—Reading the Bible and meditating on it can affect us profoundly (w05 12/1 21 ¶10)

Reading God’s Word and meditating on what we read can affect us profoundly. Does not reflecting on the account of the kings in the Davidic line encourage us to imitate the examples of those who made Jehovah their confidence and avoid the conduct of those who did not? Second Chronicles stimulates us to give our exclusive devotion to the true God and remain faithful to him. Its message certainly is alive and exerts power.—Hebrews 4:12.

## 2 Chronicles 35

```
Josiah arranges for a great Passover (1-19)
Josiah killed by Pharaoh Necho (20-27)
```

#### 2Ch 35:20-23 ​— *What warning can we find in what happened to good King Josiah?* (w17.03 27 ¶15-17)

Consider what led to his defeat and death. Josiah "went out against" King Necho of Egypt, although that king told Josiah that he had no dispute with him. The Bible says that Necho’s words were "from the mouth of God." How, though, would Josiah know that Necho’s words were from Jehovah? Well, he could have asked Jeremiah, one of the faithful prophets. (2 Chron. 35:23, 25) But there is no record of his doing so. Also, Necho was heading to Carchemish to war "against another house," not to war against Jerusalem. Moreover, God’s name was not involved, for Necho was taunting neither Jehovah nor his people. So it was bad judgment on Josiah’s part to battle against Necho. Can we see in this a lesson that we can apply? When faced with a problem, we do well to consider what Jehovah’s will may be in the matter.

If a problem arises, we ought to consider what Bible principles are involved and apply them in a balanced way. In some cases, we may want to consult with the elders. We may have given thought to what we already know about the subject, and we may even have done research in our publications. Yet, there may be other Bible principles to take into consideration, which an elder might help us to analyze. [example] We need balance as we seek to do God’s will and strive to have a good conscience.

#### 35:3—From where did Josiah have the holy Ark brought into the temple? 

Whether the Ark was removed earlier by one of the wicked kings or was relocated by Josiah for safekeeping during the extensive repair work of the temple, the Bible does not say. The only historical reference to the Ark after Solomon’s day is when Josiah brought it into the temple.

Jehoiakim, king of Judah (4-8)
Jehoiachin, king of Judah (9, 10)
Zedekiah, king of Judah (11-14)

Cyrus’ decree to rebuild the temple (22, 23)
```

#### 2Ch 36:15-17—Jehovah’s compassion and patience must not be taken for granted (w05 12/1 21 ¶7)

Jehovah is compassionate and patient. However, his compassion and patience are not limitless. People must respond favorably to the Kingdom-preaching work if they are to survive when Jehovah brings an end to this wicked system of things.
