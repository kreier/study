# Ezra

Written by Ezra in Jerusalem. The writing was completed c. 460 B.C.E. The time covered is from 537 to c. 467 B.C.E.

## Ezra 1

```
King Cyrus’ decree to rebuild the temple (1-4)
Preparations for exiles’ return from Babylon (5-11)
```

#### Ezr 1:3-6—Why were the Israelites who did not volunteer to return to Jerusalem not necessarily weak in faith? (w06 1/15 17 ¶5; 19 ¶1)

Some may not have returned to Jerusalem because they were materialistic or lacked appreciation for true worship, but this was not true in every case. First of all, the 1,000-mile **[1,600 km]** journey to Jerusalem took four or five months. Moreover, settling in a land that had remained desolate for 70 years and doing the rebuilding work there would require much physical stamina. Therefore, unfavorable circumstances, such as physical ailments, advanced age, and family obligations, undoubtedly prevented some from returning.

Like some of the Israelites who remained in Babylon, many of Jehovah’s Witnesses cannot take up the full-time ministry or serve where the need is greater. Yet, they support and encourage those who can and make voluntary donations to further the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work.

## Ezra 2

```
List of exiles who returned (1-67)
  Temple servants (43-54)
  Sons of the servants of Solomon (55-57)
Voluntary offerings for the temple (68-70)
```

## Ezra 3

```
Altar rebuilt and sacrifices offered (1-6)
The temple rebuilding begins (7-9)
Temple foundation laid (10-13)
```

### Jehovah keeps his promises

from workbook January 2016

Jehovah promised a restoration of true worship a thte temple of Jerusalem. But after the exiles return from Babylont, there were numerous obstacles, including a royal decree to halt construction. Many feared that the work would never be completed.

[nice graphic to be included in the future]

- **c. 537 B.C.E.** Cyrus decreed that the temple be rebuilt
- **seventh month** Altar set up; sacrifices offered (3:3)
- **536 B.C.E.** Foundation laid (3:10, 11)
- **Period of extreme opposition** 536 - 522 B.C.E.
- **522 B.C.E.** King Atraxerxes stopped construction (4:23, 24)
- **520 B.C.E.** Zechariah and Haggai encouraged the people to resume construction (5:1, 2)
- **515 B.C.E.** Temple completed (6:15)

## Ezra 4

```
Opposition to rebuilding the temple (1-6)
Enemies send complaint to King Artaxerxes (7-16)
Artaxerxes’ reply (17-22)
Temple construction halted (23, 24)
```

#### Ezr 4:1-3—Why was an offer of help rejected? (w06 1/15 19 ¶3)

The faithful remnant rejected an offer that would have meant forming a religious alliance with false worshippers. (Exodus 20:5; 34:12) Jehovah’s worshippers today similarly take no part in any interfaith movements.

## Ezra 5

```
The Jews resume temple building (1-5)
Tattenai’s letter to King Darius (6-17)
```

#### 5:5—Why did the opposers not stop the building work? (w86 1/15 9 ¶2) 

Jehovah’s watchcare was upon his faithful servants. (2 Chronicles 16:9) Strengthened by God’s spirit, the elders refused to be intimidated. They referred to the long-forgotten decree of Cyrus. Since Persian law was unalterable, the adversaries feared opposing a royal decree. (Daniel 6:8, 15) Jehovah’s direction was evident, and the work continued.

## Ezra 6

```
Darius’ investigation and decree (1-12)
Temple completed and inaugurated (13-18)
Passover observed (19-22)
```

## Ezra 7

```
Ezra comes to Jerusalem (1-10)
Artaxerxes’ letter to Ezra (11-26)
Ezra praises Jehovah (27, 28)
```

### Jehovah Wants Willing Servants

**7:7, 22; 8:26, 27** from workbook January 2016

Ezra made preparations to return to Jerusalem

- Ezra receives permission from King Artaxerxes to return to Jerusalem to advance worship of Jehovah there
- The king grants Ezra "everything he requested" for Jehovah's house - gold, silver, wheat, wine, oil, and salt, all worth well over $100,000,000 (U.S.) at modern values

**7:13; 8:21-23** Ezra trusted in Jehovah to protect His servants

- The return to Jerusalem would be difficult
- The possible route was nearly 1000 miles (1600 km) through dangerous territory
- The journey took about 4 months
- Those who returned needed strong faith, zeal for true worship, and courage

## Ezra 8

```
List of those returning with Ezra (1-14)
Preparations for the journey (15-30)
Departure from Babylon and arrival in Jerusalem (31-36)
```

## Ezra 9

```
Intermarriage in Israel (1-4)
Ezra’s prayer of confession (5-15)
```

#### Ezr 9:1, 2—How serious a threat was intermarriage with “the peoples of the lands”? (w06 1/15 20 ¶1)

The restored nation was to be the guardian of Jehovah’s worship until the coming of the Messiah. Intermarriage with other inhabitants was a real threat to true worship. Because some had formed marriage alliances with the idol-worshipping people, the entire nation might eventually be assimilated into the pagan nations. Pure worship could have vanished from the face of the earth. To whom, then, would the Messiah come? No wonder Ezra was stunned at seeing what had taken place!

## Ezra 10

```
Covenant to send away foreign wives (1-14)
Foreign wives dismissed (15-44)
```

#### Ezr 10:3—Why were the children sent away along with the wives? (w06 1/15 20 ¶2)

If the children had stayed behind, the likelihood that the dismissed wives would return on account of them would have increased. Moreover, little children generally require the care of their mother.
