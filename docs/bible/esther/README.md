- He encouraged Esther to be courageous and trust in Jehovah (Es 4:12-14; ia 133 ¶22-23)

**ASK YOURSELF,**  ‘Do my words and actions help others in the congregation to reach their full potential?’

#### Es 4:12-16​—How do we fight for freedom to worship, as Esther and Mordecai did? (kr 160 ¶14)

Like Esther and Mordecai of old, Jehovah’s people today fight for the freedom to worship Jehovah in the way that  he has commanded. (Esther 4:13-16) Can you have a part? Yes. You can pray regularly for your spiritual brothers and sisters who are currently suffering on account of legal injustices. Such prayers can be a powerful aid to our brothers and sisters under hardship and persecution. (Read James 5:16.) Does Jehovah act on such prayers? Our victories in court suggest that he certainly does!​—Heb. 13:18, 19.
