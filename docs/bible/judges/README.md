# Judges

Written by Samuel in Israel. The writing was completed c. 1100 B.C.E. The time covered is from c. 1450 to c. 1120 B.C.E.

## Judges 1

```
Judah and Simeon’s conquests (1-20)
Jebusites persist in Jerusalem (21)
Joseph takes Bethel (22-26)
Canaanites not completely driven out (27-36)
```

## Judges 2

```
Warning from Jehovah’s angel (1-5)
Death of Joshua (6-10)
Judges raised up to save Israel (11-23)
```

#### Jg 2:10-12​—How is this a warning example for us? (w05 1/15 24 ¶7)

We must have a regular program  of Bible study so as ‘not to forget Jehovah’s doings.’ (Psalm 103:2) Parents need to sound down the truth of God’s Word into the hearts of their children.​—Deuteronomy 6:6-9.

**2:14, 21, 22.** Jehovah allows bad things to happen to his disobedient people for a purpose​—to chastise them, to refine them, and to move them to return to him.

## Judges 3

```
Jehovah tests Israel (1-6)
Othniel, the first judge (7-11)
Judge Ehud kills fat King Eglon (12-30)
Judge Shamgar (31)
```

### A Story of Courage and Intrigue

from [workbook November–December 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-22-28-2021/A-Story-of-Courage-and-Intrigue/)

- Jehovah raised up Ehud to deliver Israel from the Moabites (Jg 3:15; w04 3/15 31 ¶3)
- Ehud assassinated King Eglon and led Israel to victory (Jg 3:16-23, 30; w04 3/15 30 ¶1-3)
- What does this account teach us about courage and reliance on Jehovah?

## Judges 4

```
Canaanite King Jabin oppresses Israel (1-3)
Prophetess Deborah and Judge Barak (4-16)
Jael kills army chief Sisera (17-24)
```

**4:8**​—*Why did Barak insist that the prophetess Deborah go with him to the battlefield?* Evidently, Barak felt inadequate to go up against Sisera’s army by himself. Having the prophetess with him would reassure him and his men that they had God’s guidance and would give them confidence. Barak’s insistence that Deborah accompany him, then, was not a sign of weakness but of strong faith.

### Jehovah Uses Two Women to Deliver His People

from [workbook November–December 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-November-29-December-5-2021/Jehovah-Uses-Two-Women-to-Deliver-His-People/)

- A fearsome enemy oppressed Israel (Jg 4:3; 5:6-8; w15 8/1 13 ¶1)
- Jehovah raised up Deborah to help his people (Jg 4:4-7; 5:7; w15 8/1 13 ¶2; see cover picture)
- Jehovah used Jael to execute Sisera (Jg 4:16, 17, 21; w15 8/1 15 ¶2)

## Judges 5

```
Victory song of Deborah and Barak (1-31)
  Stars fight against Sisera (20)
  Torrent of Kishon floods (21)
  Those loving Jehovah are like the sun (31)
```

#### Jg 5:20​—How did the stars fight from the heavens in behalf of Barak? (w05 1/15 25 ¶5)

The Bible does not say whether this involved angelic assistance, meteorite showers that were interpreted ominously by Sisera’s wise men, or perhaps astrological predictions for Sisera that proved false. Undoubtedly, however, there was some type of divine intervention.

## Judges 6

```
Midian oppresses Israel (1-10)
An angel assures Judge Gideon of support (11-24)
Gideon tears down altar of Baal (25-32)
God’s spirit active on Gideon (33-35)
The fleece test (36-40)
```

#### Jg 6:27​—How can Gideon’s example help us in the ministry? (w05 1/15 26 ¶6)

Gideon used discretion so as not to anger his opposers needlessly. When preaching the good news, we must be careful not to offend others unduly by the way we speak.

### “Go With the Strength You Have”

from [workbook November–December 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-6-12-2021/Go-With-the-Strength-You-Have/)

- Jehovah gave Gideon a daunting assignment (Jg 6:2-6, 14)
- Gideon felt unqualified and unworthy (Jg 6:15; w02 2/15 6-7)
- Gideon was successful because of Jehovah’s strength (Jg 7:19-22; w05 7/15 16 ¶3)

Jehovah expects us to use the strength we have to worship him. His holy spirit can make up for any lack and give us success.​—Isa 40:30, 31.

## Judges 7

```
Gideon and his 300 men (1-8)
Gideon’s army defeats Midian (9-25)
  “The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon!” (20)
  Confusion in the Midianite camp (21, 22)
```

## Judges 8

```
Ephraimites quarrel with Gideon (1-3)
Midianite kings pursued and killed (4-21)
Gideon refuses kingship (22-27)
Summary of Gideon’s life (28-35)
```

#### Jg 8:27​—Did Gideon worship the ephod that he made? (it-1 753 ¶1)

In spite of Gideon’s good intentions to commemorate the victory Jehovah had given Israel and to honor God, the ephod “served as a snare to Gideon and to his household,” because the Israelites committed spiritual immorality by worshiping it. (Jg 8:27) However, the Bible does not say that Gideon himself worshiped it; on the contrary, he is specifically named by the apostle Paul as one of the ‘great cloud’ of faithful pre-Christian witnesses of Jehovah.​—Heb 11:32; 12:1.

### Humility Is Better Than Pride

from [workbook November–December 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-13-19-2021/Humility-Is-Better-Than-Pride/)

- Humility helped Gideon to promote peace (Jg 8:1-3; w00 8/15 25 ¶3)
- Humility caused Gideon to seek Jehovah’s glory rather than his own (Jg 8:22, 23; w17.01 20 ¶15)
- Pride resulted in Abimelech bringing harm upon himself and others (Jg 9:1, 2, 5, 22-24; w08 2/15 9 ¶9)

## Judges 9

```
Abimelech becomes king in Shechem (1-6)
Jotham’s parable (7-21)
Abimelech’s violent rule (22-33)
Abimelech assaults Shechem (34-49)
Woman wounds Abimelech; he dies (50-57)
```

## Judges 10

```
Judges Tola and Jair (1-5)
Israel rebels and repents (6-16)
Ammonites threaten Israel (17, 18)
```

## Judges 11

```
Judge Jephthah expelled, later made leader (1-11)
Jephthah reasons with Ammon (12-28)
Jephthah’s vow and his daughter (29-40)
  Daughter’s life of singleness (38-40)
```

#### Jg 11:1​—How do we know that Jephthah was not an illegitimate son? (it-2 26)

The mother of Jephthah was “a prostitute woman,” not meaning, however, that Jephthah was born of prostitution or was illegitimate. His mother *had been* a prostitute prior to her marriage as a secondary wife to Gilead, just as Rahab had once been a prostitute but later married Salmon. (Jg 11:1; Jos 2:1; Mt 1:5) That Jephthah was not illegitimate is proved by the fact that his half brothers by Gilead’s primary wife drove him out so that he would not share in the inheritance. (Jg 11:2) Additionally, Jephthah later became the accepted leader of the men of Gilead (of whom Jephthah’s half brothers seemed to be foremost). (Jg 11:11) Moreover, he offered a sacrifice to God at the tabernacle. (Jg 11:30, 31) None of these things would have been possible for an illegitimate son, for the Law specifically stated: “No illegitimate son may come into the congregation of Jehovah. Even to the tenth generation none of his may come into the congregation of Jehovah.”​—De 23:2.

### Jephthah—A Spiritual Man

from [workbook November–December 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-20-26-2021/Jephthah-A-Spiritual-Man/)

- Jephthah set aside personal differences with others (Jg 11:5-9; w16.04 7 ¶9)
- Jephthah was a student of Jehovah’s dealings with His people (Jg 11:12-15; it-2 27 ¶2)
- Jephthah kept his focus on the central issue ​—Jehovah’s Godship (Jg 11:23, 24, 27; it-2 27 ¶3)

In what specific ways am I demonstrating that I am a spiritual person?

## Judges 12

```
Conflict with the Ephraimites (1-7)
  Shibboleth test (6)
Judges Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (8-15)
```

## Judges 13

```
An angel visits Manoah and his wife (1-23)
Birth of Samson (24, 25)
```

### What Parents Can Learn From Manoah and His Wife

from [workbook November–December 2021](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/november-december-2021-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-December-27-2021-January-2-2022/What-Parents-Can-Learn-From-Manoah-and-His-Wife/)

- Be a good example of faithfulness to the true God (Jg 13:1, 2, 6)
- Seek Jehovah’s direction (Jg 13:8; w13 8/15 16 ¶1)
- Do not hold back from giving your children correction (Jg 14:1-4; w05 3/15 25-26)

## Judges 14

```
Judge Samson seeks a Philistine wife (1-4)
Samson kills a lion by Jehovah’s spirit (5-9)
Samson’s riddle at the wedding (10-19)
Samson’s wife given to another man (20)
```

#### Jg 14:2, 3​—In what way was this Philistine woman “the right one” for Samson? (w05 3/15 26 ¶1)

In what way was this particular Philistine woman “just right” for Samson? Not in the sense that she was “beautiful, engaging, attractive,” suggests McClintock and Strong’s *Cyclopedia*, “but right relative to an end, purpose, or object.” Relative to what end? Judges 14:4 explains that Samson “was looking for an opportunity against the Philistines.” Samson was interested in the woman for that purpose. As Samson grew to adulthood, “Jehovah’s spirit started to impel him,” or stir him to action. (Judges 13:25) So the spirit of Jehovah was the driving force behind Samson’s unusual request for a wife as well as his entire career as judge over Israel. Did Samson get the opportunity he was seeking? Let us first consider how Jehovah assured him of divine backing.

```
Samson’s revenge on the Philistines (1-20)
