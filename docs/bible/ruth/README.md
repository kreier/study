# Ruth

Written by Samuel in Israel. The writing was completed c. 1090 B.C.E. The time covered is a period of 11 years during the Judges' rule.

## Ruth 1

```
Elimelech’s family moves to Moab (1, 2)
Naomi, Orpah, and Ruth widowed (3-6)
Ruth loyal to Naomi and her God (7-17)
Naomi returns to Bethlehem with Ruth (18-22)
```

#### Ru 1:20, 21​—Why did Naomi say that Jehovah had made her life bitter? (w05 3/1 27 ¶1)

Naomi did not charge God with any wrongdoing. In view of all that had happened to her, however, she thought that Jehovah was against her. She felt bitter and disillusioned. Moreover, in those days the fruitage of the belly was considered a divine blessing and barrenness, a curse. Lacking grandchildren and with two sons dead, Naomi might have felt justified in thinking that Jehovah had humiliated her.

## Ruth 4

```
Boaz acts as a repurchaser (1-12)
Obed born to Boaz and Ruth (13-17)
Genealogy of David (18-22)
```

#### Ru 4:6​—In what way could a repurchaser “ruin” his own inheritance by doing the repurchasing? (w05 3/1 29 ¶3)

First of all, if the one falling into poverty had sold his land inheritance, a repurchaser would have to put out money to buy the land at a price determined by the number of years remaining till the next Jubilee. (Leviticus 25:25-27) Doing so would reduce the value of his own estate. Moreover, should a son be born to Ruth, that son, rather than any of the repurchaser’s current near relatives, would inherit the purchased field.
