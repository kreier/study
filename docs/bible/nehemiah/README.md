# Nehemiah

Written by Nehemiah in Jerusalem. The writing was completed a. 443 B.C.E. The time covered is from 456 to a. 443 B.C.E.

## Nehemiah 1

```
News from Jerusalem (1-3)
Nehemiah’s prayer (4-11)
```


## Nehemiah 2

```
Nehemiah sent to Jerusalem (1-10)
Nehemiah inspects the city walls (11-20)
```

#### Ne 2:4​—Was this a last-minute prayer of desperation, and what is the lesson for us? (w86 2/15 25)

No, for Jerusalem’s devastated condition had been the subject of Nehemiah’s prayers “day and night” for quite some time. (1:4, 6) When afforded the opportunity to tell King Artaxerxes about his desire to rebuild Jerusalem’s walls, Nehemiah again prayed, thus doing what he already had done repeatedly. Jehovah’s favorable answer resulted in a commission to rebuild the city’s walls.

**Lesson for Us:** Nehemiah looked to Jehovah for direction. When faced with weighty decisions, we, too, should “persevere in prayer” and act in harmony with Jehovah’s guidance.​—Romans 12:12.

### “At Once I Prayed”

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-24-30-2023/At-Once-I-Prayed/)

- Nehemiah prayed before answering the king’s question (Ne 2:2-4; w08 2/15 3 ¶5)
- Nehemiah’s request was favorably heard by the king (Ne 2:5, 6)

**FOR MEDITATION:** What could we do if we are asked to give an impromptu explanation of our beliefs?​—be 177 ¶4.

## Nehemiah 3

```
Rebuilding the walls (1-32)
```

### Is Manual Work Beneath You?

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-31-August-6-2023/Is-Manual-Work-Beneath-You/)

- The high priest and his brothers did not view themselves as too important to share in rebuilding Jerusalem’s walls (Ne 3:1)
- Some prominent men refused to “lower themselves” to help with the repair work (Ne 3:5; w06 2/1 10 ¶1)
- God-fearing women willingly shared in the physically demanding project (Ne 3:12; w19.10 23 ¶11)

Many tasks that must be performed in the congregation involve manual or menial work and may occur behind the scenes.​—w04 8/1 18 ¶16.

## Nehemiah 4

```
Work progresses despite opposition (1-14)
Construction continues with workers armed (15-23)
```

#### Ne 4:17, 18​—How could a man do the work of rebuilding with just one hand? (w06 2/1 9 ¶1)

For burden bearers this would not be a problem. Once the load was placed on their head or shoulders, they could easily balance it with one hand “while the other hand was holding the missile.” The builders who needed both hands to do their work “were girded, each one with his sword upon his hip, while building.” They were ready to go into action in case of an enemy attack.

## Nehemiah 5

```
Nehemiah stops exploitation (1-13)
Nehemiah’s unselfishness (14-19)
```

### Nehemiah Wanted to Serve, Not Be Served

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-7-13-2023/Nehemiah-Wanted-to-Serve-Not-Be-Served/)

- Nehemiah did not use his authority for selfish gain (Ne 5:14, 15, 17, 18; w02 11/1 27 ¶3)
- Nehemiah did not just oversee the work; he also participated in it (Ne 5:16; w16.09 6 ¶16)
- Nehemiah asked Jehovah to remember him for his self-sacrificing love (Ne 5:19; w00 2/1 32)

Although Nehemiah was the governor, he did not expect special treatment. He is a good example for those who have privileges and responsibilities in the congregation.

**ASK YOURSELF,** ‘Am I more interested in what I can do for others than in what others can do for me?’

## Nehemiah 6

```
Opposition to the rebuilding continues (1-14)
Wall completed in 52 days (15-19)
```

#### Ne 6:13​—Why would it have been a sin for Nehemiah to hide in the temple? (w07 7/1 30 ¶15)

Nehemiah’s enemies used a traitor, the Israelite Shemaiah, to try to make Nehemiah break God’s Law. Shemaiah said to Nehemiah: “Let us meet by appointment at the house of the true God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming in to kill you.” Shemaiah said that Nehemiah was about to be assassinated but that he could save his life by hiding in the temple. However, Nehemiah was not a priest. He would commit a sin by hiding in the house of God. Would he break God’s Law in an attempt to save his life? Nehemiah responded: “Who is there like me that could enter into the temple and live? I shall not enter!” Why did Nehemiah not fall into the trap that had been set for him? Because he knew that although Shemaiah was a fellow Israelite, “it was not God that had sent him.” After all, a true prophet would never advise him to break God’s Law. Again, Nehemiah did not let himself be conquered by evil opposers. Shortly thereafter he could report: “At length the wall came to completion on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two  days.”​—Nehemiah 6:10-15; Numbers 1:51; 18:7.

## Nehemiah 7

```
City gates and gatekeepers (1-4)
List of exiles who returned (5-69)
  Temple servants (46-56)
  Sons of the servants of Solomon (57-60)
Contributions for the work (70-73)
```


## Nehemiah 8

```
The Law is read and explained to the people (1-12)
Festival of Booths observed (13-18)
```

#### Ne 8:2, 8​—If those in attendance “could listen with understanding” to the reading of the Law, why did the Levites also explain it? (it-1 145 ¶2)

A number of years after the Jews returned from Babylonian exile Ezra the priest read the book of the Law to Jews assembled in Jerusalem, and various Levites explained it to the people, Nehemiah 8:8 stating: “They continued reading aloud from the book, from the law of the true God, it being expounded, and there being a putting of meaning into it; and they continued giving understanding in the reading.” This expounding or interpreting may have involved paraphrasing the Hebrew text into Aramaic, Aramaic possibly having been adopted by the Hebrews when in Babylon. The expounding also, no doubt, involved exposition so that the Jews, even if understanding the Hebrew, would comprehend the deep significance of what was being read.

### “The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold”

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-14-20-2023/The-Joy-of-Jehovah-Is-Your-Stronghold/)

- The people congregated to hear Ezra read the Law (Ne 8:1, 2; w13 10/15 21 ¶2; see cover picture)
- This was to be a joyous time in the worship of Jehovah, not a time to mourn over past sins (Ne 8:9, 11, 12)
- The joy of Jehovah is a stronghold for his servants (Ne 8:10; w07 7/15 22 ¶9-10)

## Nehemiah 9

```
The people confess their sins (1-38)
  Jehovah, a forgiving God (17)
```


## Nehemiah 10

```
The people agree to follow the Law (1-39)
  “We will not neglect the house of our God” (39)
```

#### Ne 10:34​—Why were the people required to supply wood? (w06 2/1 11 ¶1)

The wood offering was not commanded in the Mosaic Law. This requirement stemmed strictly from the need. Large quantities of wood were needed in order to burn the sacrifices on the altar. Apparently, there were not enough Nethinim, who served as non-Israelite temple slaves. Hence, lots were cast to ensure a continuous supply of wood.

## Nehemiah 11

```
Jerusalem repopulated (1-36)
```

### They Made Personal Sacrifices for Jehovah

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-21-27-2023/They-Made-Personal-Sacrifices-for-Jehovah/)

- Families were asked to leave their hereditary possession and move to Jerusalem (Ne 11:1; w98 10/15 22 ¶13)
- Those who were willing to make such sacrifices were blessed (Ne 11:2; w86 2/15 26)
- Blessings from Jehovah are always greater than any sacrifices we may make (Mal 3:10; w16.04 8 ¶15)

## Nehemiah 12

```
The priests and the Levites (1-26)
Inauguration of the wall (27-43)
Support for the temple service (44-47)
```


## Nehemiah 13

```
Further reforms by Nehemiah (1-31)
  Tenth parts to be given (10-13)
  Sabbath not to be profaned (15-22)
  Intermarriage condemned (23-28)
```

#### Ne 13:10​—Since temple singers were Levites, why were they listed separately? (it-2 452 ¶9)

Considerable importance was attached to the singing at the temple. This is evident from the many Scriptural references to the singers as well as from the fact that they were “set free from  duty” common to other Levites in order to devote themselves wholly to their service. (1Ch 9:33) Their continuance as a special group of Levites is emphasized by their being listed separately among those returning from Babylon. (Ezr 2:40, 41) Even the authority of the Persian king Artaxerxes (Longimanus) was brought to bear in their behalf, exempting them, along with other special groups, from ‘tax, tribute, and toll.’ (Ezr 7:24) Later, the king commanded that there was to be “a fixed provision for the singers as each day required.” Although Artaxerxes is credited with this order, most likely it was issued by Ezra on the basis of the power granted to him by Artaxerxes. (Ne 11:23; Ezr 7:18-26) Thus, it is understandable that, although the singers were all Levites, the Bible makes reference to them as a special body, speaking of “the singers and the Levites.”​—Ne 7:1; 13:10.

### Be Loyal to Jehovah When Choosing Friends

from [workbook July–August 2023](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-august-2023-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-28-September-3-2023/Be-Loyal-to-Jehovah-When-Choosing-Friends/)

- Ammonites and Moabites were not permitted to “enter the congregation” because of their history of opposition to God’s people (Ne 13:1, 2; it-1 95 ¶5)
- High Priest Eliashib allowed an Ammonite to make use of a dining hall in the temple (Ne 13:4, 5; w13 8/15 4 ¶5-6)
- Nehemiah showed loyalty to Jehovah by ending Eliashib’s arrangement with God’s enemy (Ne 13:7-9)

If we choose friends who do not love Jehovah, are we being loyal to Jehovah?​—w96 3/15 16 ¶6.
