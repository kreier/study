# Exodus

Written by Moses in the wildernis. The writing was completed 1512 B.C.E. The time covered is from 1657 to 1512 B.C.E.

## Exodus 1

```
Israelites multiply in Egypt (1-7)
Pharaoh oppresses the Israelites (8-14)
God-fearing midwives save lives (15-22)
```

**1:15** The names of the midwives were Shiphʹrah and Puʹah. In a culture where women are often not mentioned in genealogical registers, these two are preserved with their names and were blessed for their faithfulness with families (1:21). But the name of the powerful Pharʹaoh is unknown, lost in history.

## Exodus 2

```
Birth of Moses (1-4)
Pharaoh’s daughter adopts Moses (5-10)
Moses flees to Midian and marries Zipporah (11-22)
God hears Israelites’ groaning (23-25)
```

#### Ex 2:10​—Why is it reasonable to believe that Pharaoh’s daughter adopted Moses? (g04 4/8 6 ¶5)

Is it not farfetched, though, to believe that an Egyptian princess would take in such a child? No, for Egyptian religion taught that kind deeds were a requisite for entrance into heaven. As for the adoption itself, archaeologist Joyce Tyldesley observes: “Egyptian women achieved parity with Egyptian men. They enjoyed the same legal and economic rights, at least in theory, and . . . women could make adoptions.” The ancient Adoption Papyrus actually documents one Egyptian woman’s adoption of her slaves. As for the hiring of Moses’ mother as a wet nurse, The Anchor Bible Dictionary says: “The payment of Moses’ natural mother to nurse him . . . echoes identical arrangements in Mesopotamian adoption contracts.”

## Exodus 3

```
Moses and the burning thornbush (1-12)
Jehovah explains His name (13-15)
Jehovah instructs Moses (16-22)
```

#### Ex 3:1​—What kind of priest was Jethro? (w04 3/15 24 ¶4)

In patriarchal times the family head served as a priest for his family. Jethro was evidently the patriarchal head of a tribe of Midianites. Since the Midianites were Abraham’s descendants by Keturah, they were perhaps exposed to the worship of Jehovah.​—Genesis 25:1, 2.

### “I Will Become What I Choose to Become”

**3:13, 14** from workbook June 2020

Jehovah revealed to Moses a thrilling aspect of His own nature. Within the bounds of his perfect standards, Jehovah becomes whatever is needed in each circumstance to accomplish his will. Much like a human parent, Jehovah fills whatever roles are necessary to care for his children.

What roles has Jehovah filled in my life?

## Exodus 4

```
Three signs for Moses to perform (1-9)
Moses feels inadequate (10-17)
Moses returns to Egypt (18-26)
Moses reunites with Aaron (27-31)
```

#### Ex 4:24-26​—For what possible reason did Zipporah call Jehovah “a bridegroom of blood”? (w04 3/15 28 ¶4)

Zipporah’s expression “you are a bridegroom of blood to me” is an unusual one. What does it indicate about her? By her compliance with the requirements of the circumcision covenant, Zipporah acknowledged a covenant relationship with Jehovah. The Law covenant later made with the Israelites showed that in a covenant relationship, Jehovah can be thought of as a husband and the other party as a wife. (Jeremiah 31:32) Hence, in addressing Jehovah (through his representative angel) as “a bridegroom of blood,” Zipporah appears to have been acknowledging her own submission to the terms of that covenant. It was as if she had accepted a wifely position in the circumcision covenant, with Jehovah God as the husband. In any case, because of her decisive act of obedience to God’s requirement, the life of her son was no longer in danger.

### “I Will Be With You as You Speak”

**4:10-15** from workbook June 2020

With Jehovah’s help, Moses overcame his fears. What can we learn from Jehovah’s interaction with Moses?
- We should avoid focusing on our own inadequacies
- We can be confident that Jehovah will give us whatever we need to fulfill our assignments
- Faith in God is the antidote to fear of man

## Exodus 5

```
Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh (1-5)
Oppression grows (6-18)
Israel blames Moses and Aaron (19-23)
```

#### Ex 5:2​—In what sense did Pharaoh not know Jehovah? (it-2 12 ¶5)

To “know,” therefore, does not necessarily mean merely to be acquainted with or cognizant of something or someone. The foolish Nabal knew David’s name but still asked, “Who is David?” in the sense of asking, “What does he amount to?” (1Sa 25:9-11; compare 2Sa 8:13.) So, too, Pharaoh had said to Moses: “Who is Jehovah, so that I should obey his voice to send Israel away? I do not know Jehovah at all and, what is more, I am not going to send Israel away.” (Ex 5:1, 2) By that, Pharaoh evidently meant that he did not know Jehovah as the true God or as having any authority over Egypt’s king and his affairs, nor as having any might to enforce His will as announced by Moses and Aaron. But now Pharaoh and all Egypt, along with the Israelites, would come to know the real meaning of that name, the person it represented. As Jehovah showed Moses, this would result from God’s carrying out His purpose toward Israel, liberating them, giving them the Promised Land, and thereby fulfilling His covenant with their forefathers. In this way, as God said, “You will certainly know that I am Jehovah your God.”​—Ex 6:4-8; see ALMIGHTY.

## Exodus 6

```
Promise of freedom renewed (1-13)
  Jehovah’s name not fully known (2, 3)
Genealogy of Moses and Aaron (14-27)
Moses again to appear before Pharaoh (28-30)
```

#### Ex 6:3​—In what sense did Jehovah not make his name known to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? (it-1 78 ¶3-4)

Jehovah used the title “God Almighty” (*ʼEl Shad·daiʹ*) when making his promise to Abraham concerning the birth of Isaac, a promise requiring that Abraham have great faith in God’s power to carry out that promise. It was thereafter used when God was spoken of as the one who would bless Isaac and Jacob as heirs of the Abrahamic covenant.​—Ge 17:1; 28:3; 35:11; 48:3.

In harmony with this, Jehovah could later say to Moses: “I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as God Almighty [*beʼElʹ Shad·daiʹ*], but as respects my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them.” (Ex 6:3) This could not mean that the name Jehovah was unknown to these patriarchs, since it was frequently used by them as well as by others before them. (Ge 4:1, 26; 14:22; 27:27; 28:16) In fact, in the book of Genesis, which relates the lives of the patriarchs, the word “Almighty” occurs only 6 times, whereas the personal name Jehovah was written 172 times in the original Hebrew text. Yet, while these patriarchs had come to appreciate by personal experience God’s right to and qualifications for the title of “the Almighty One,” they had not had opportunity to appreciate the full meaning and implications of his personal name, Jehovah. In this regard, *The Illustrated Bible Dictionary* (Vol. 1, p. 572) comments: “The former revelation, to the Patriarchs, concerned promises belonging to a distant future; it supposed that they should be assured that He, Yahweh, was such a God (*ʼel*) as was competent (one possible meaning of *sadday*) to fulfill them. The revelation at the bush was greater and more intimate, God’s power and immediate and continuing presence with them being all wrapped up in the familiar name of Yahweh.”​—Edited by J. D. Douglas, 1980.

### “Now You Will See What I Will Do to Pharaoh”

**6:1, 6, 7; 7:4, 5** from workbook July 2020

Before bringing the plagues on Egypt and delivering the Israelites from slavery, Jehovah told the Israelites what he was about to do. They would see Jehovah’s power demonstrated in ways that they had not previously witnessed, and the Egyptians would certainly know who Jehovah is. When God’s promises came true, the faith of the Israelites was strengthened, and this helped to counteract the false religious influences they had been exposed to in Egypt.

## Exodus 7

```
Jehovah strengthens Moses (1-7)
Aaron’s rod becomes a big snake (8-13)
Plague 1: water turned into blood (14-25)
```

#### Ex 7:1​—How was Moses “like God” to Pharaoh, and how did Aaron become Moses’ “prophet”? (it-2 435 ¶5)

***Moses not disqualified because of diffidence.*** But Moses showed diffidence, arguing that he was unable to speak fluently. Here was a changed Moses, quite different from the one who had, of his own accord, offered himself as Israel’s deliverer 40 years earlier. He continued to remonstrate with Jehovah, finally asking Jehovah to excuse him from the task. Although this aroused God’s anger, he did not reject Moses but provided Moses’ brother Aaron as a mouthpiece. Thus, as Moses was representative for God, so Moses became as “God” to Aaron, who spoke representatively for him. In the ensuing meeting with the older men of Israel and the encounters with Pharaoh, it appears that God gave Moses the instructions and commands and Moses, in turn, relayed them to Aaron, so that Aaron did the actual speaking before Pharaoh (a successor of the Pharaoh from whom Moses had fled 40 years previously). (Ex 2:23; 4:10-17) Later, Jehovah spoke of Aaron as Moses’ “prophet,” meaning that, as Moses was God’s prophet, directed by him, so Aaron should be directed by Moses. Also, Moses was told that he was being made “God to Pharaoh,” that is, given divine power and authority over Pharaoh, so that there was now no need to be afraid of the king of Egypt.​—Ex 7:1, 2.

## Exodus 8

```
Plague 2: frogs (1-15)
Plague 3: gnats (16-19)
Plague 4: gadflies (20-32)
  Goshen not affected (22, 23)
```

#### Ex 8:21​—What was the gadfly? (it-1 878)

[Heb., *ʽa·rovʹ*].

There is some uncertainty as to the particular insect designated by the original Hebrew word appearing in the Scriptures with reference to the fourth plague upon Egypt, the first from which the Israelites in Goshen were spared. (Ex 8:21, 22, 24, 29, 31; Ps 78:45; 105:31) ʽ*A·rov*ʹ has been variously rendered “gadfly” (*JB, NW, Ro*), “beetle” (*Yg*), “flies” (*AS, KJ, RS*), “gnats” (*AT*), and “dog fly” (*LXX*).

The English designation “gadfly” includes the various kinds of horseflies and botflies. Female horseflies pierce the skin of animals as well as man and then suck their blood. In the larval stage botflies live as parasites in the bodies of animals and man; those that infest humans are found in the tropics. A plague of gadflies would, therefore, have brought great suffering to the Egyptians and their livestock and, in certain cases, even death.

#### Ex 8:25-27​—Why did Moses say that Israel’s sacrifices would be “detestable to the Egyptians”? (w04 3/15 25 ¶9)

Many different animals were venerated in Egypt. The mention of sacrifices thus added force and persuasiveness to Moses’ insistence that Israel be allowed to go away to sacrifice to Jehovah.

### Proud Pharaoh Unwittingly Serves God’s Purpose

**8:15, 18, 19; 9:15-17** from workbook July 2020

Egyptian pharaohs viewed themselves as gods. This helps us understand why Pharaoh was too proud to listen to Moses and Aaron and even to his own magic-practicing priests.

Do you listen when others make suggestions? Do you appreciate it when someone counsels you? Or do you feel that you are always right? “Pride is before a crash.” (Pr 16:18) How important it is to guard against pride!

## Exodus 9

```
Plague 5: death of livestock (1-7)
Plague 6: boils on man and beast (8-12)
Plague 7: hail (13-35)
  Pharaoh to see God’s power (16)
  Jehovah’s name to be declared (16)
```

## Exodus 10

```
Plague 8: locusts (1-20)
Plague 9: darkness (21-29)
```

#### Ex 10:1, 2​—What lesson can parents take from these verses? (w95 9/1 11 ¶11)

While the Israelites were still in Egypt, Jehovah sent Moses to Pharaoh and said: “Go in to Pharaoh, because I​—I have let his heart and the hearts of his servants become unresponsive, in order that I may set these signs of mine right before him, and in order that you may declare in the ears of your son and your son’s son how severely I have dealt with Egypt and my signs that I have established among them; and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah.” (Exodus 10:1, 2) Obedient Israelites would tell their children of Jehovah’s mighty acts. Their children, in turn, would tell of them to their children, and so it would be done from generation to generation. Thus, Jehovah’s powerful deeds would be remembered. Likewise today, parents have the responsibility of witnessing to their children.​—Deuteronomy 6:4-7; Proverbs 22:6.

### Moses and Aaron Demonstrate Great Courage

**10:3-6, 24-26, 28; 11:4-8** from workbook July 2020

Moses and Aaron demonstrated great courage and boldness when speaking to Pharaoh, the most powerful man in the world at that time. What enabled them to do it? Regarding Moses, the Bible says: “By faith he left Egypt, but not fearing the anger of the king, for he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.” (Heb 11:27) Moses and Aaron had strong faith in Jehovah and relied on him.

## Exodus 11

```
Tenth plague announced (1-10)
  Israelites to ask for gifts (2)
```

#### Ex 11:7​—What did Jehovah mean when he said that “not even a dog will bark at the Israelites”? (it-1 783 ¶5)

So by a spectacular display of power Jehovah exalted his name and delivered Israel. Safe on the E shore of the Red Sea, Moses led the sons of Israel in a song, while his sister Miriam, the prophetess, took a tambourine in her hand and led all the women with tambourines and in dances, responding in song to the men. (Ex 15:1, 20, 21) A complete separation of Israel from their foes had been effected. When they went out from Egypt they were not allowed to suffer harm from man or beast; no dog even snarled at the Israelites or moved its tongue against them. (Ex 11:7) While the Exodus narrative does not mention that Pharaoh personally went into the sea with his military forces and was destroyed, Psalm 136:15 does state that Jehovah “shook off Pharaoh and his military force into the Red Sea.”

## Exodus 12

```
Institution of Passover (1-28)
  Blood to be splashed on doorposts (7)
Plague 10: firstborn killed (29-32)
The Exodus begins (33-42)
  End of 430 years (40, 41)
Instructions for Passover participation (43-51)
```

#### Ex 12:12​—How were the plagues on the Egyptians, especially the tenth one, a judgment against their false gods? (it-2 582 ¶2)

The Ten Plagues upon Egypt all proved to be a judgment against the gods of Egypt, especially the tenth, the death of the firstborn. (Ex 12:12) For the ram (male sheep) was sacred to the god Ra, so that splashing the blood of the Passover lamb on the doorways would be blasphemy in the eyes of the Egyptians. Also, the bull was sacred, and the destruction of the firstborn of the bulls would be a blow to the god Osiris. Pharaoh himself was venerated as a son of Ra. The death of Pharaoh’s own firstborn would thus show the impotence of both Ra and Pharaoh.

#### Ex 12:14-16​—The Festival of Unfermented Cakes, as with other holy conventions, had what unique feature, and how did it benefit the Israelites? (it-1 504 ¶1)

A unique feature of all of these “holy conventions” was that during them the people were to do no laborious work. For instance, the first and seventh days of the Festival of Unfermented Cakes were “holy conventions,” concerning which Jehovah stated: “No work is to be done on them. Only what every soul needs to eat, that alone may be done for you.” (Ex 12:15, 16) However, during “holy conventions” the priests were busy offering sacrifices to Jehovah (Le 23:37, 38), certainly no violation of any command against doing normal daily work. These occasions were not periods of idleness for the people in general either but were times of great spiritual benefit. On the weekly Sabbath day, the people met together for public worship and instruction. They were then edified by the public reading and explanation of God’s written Word, as in the later synagogues. (Ac 15:21) Therefore, while the people did not do laborious work during the Sabbath day or the other “holy conventions,” they would then devote themselves to prayer and meditation on the Creator and his purposes.​—See ASSEMBLY.

### The Passover​—Its Significance for Christians

**12:5-7, 12, 13, 24-27** from [workbook July 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/july-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-July-27-August-2-2020/The-Passover-Its-Significance-for-Christians/)

In order for the Israelites to avoid being harmed by the tenth plague, it was vital for them to obey instructions. (Ex 12:28) On the night of Nisan 14, families were to assemble in their own home. They were to kill a sound one-year-old male lamb or goat. Its blood was to be sprinkled on the doorposts and on the upper part of the doorway. Then they were to roast the entire animal and eat it in a hurry. No one was to go out of the house until morning.​—Ex 12:9-11, 22.

## Exodus 13

```
Every firstborn male belongs to Jehovah (1, 2)
Festival of Unleavened Bread (3-10)
Every firstborn male devoted to God (11-16)
Israel directed toward the Red Sea (17-20)
Pillar of cloud and of fire (21, 22)
```

#### Ex 13:17​—How did Jehovah show consideration for the Israelites when leading them out of Egypt? ([it-1 1117](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/Insight-on-the-Scriptures/Highway-Road/#p3))

From ancient times highways and roads, including several important trade routes, linked cities and kingdoms in the area of Palestine. (Nu 20:17-19; 21:21, 22; 22:5, 21-23; Jos 2:22; Jg 21:19; 1Sa 6:9, 12; 13:17, 18; see KING’S ROAD.) What is considered to have been the principal route led from Egypt to the Philistine cities of Gaza and Ashkelon and gradually bent northeastward in the direction of Megiddo. It continued to Hazor, N of the Sea of Galilee, and then led to Damascus. This route via Philistia was the shortest from Egypt to the Promised Land. But Jehovah kindly led the Israelites by another way so that they would not get disheartened by a Philistine attack.​—Ex 13:17.

## Exodus 14

```
Israel reaches the sea (1-4)
Pharaoh pursues Israel (5-14)
Israel crosses the Red Sea (15-25)
Egyptians drown in the sea (26-28)
Israel puts faith in Jehovah (29-31)
```

#### Ex 14:2​—Where was the Red Sea possibly parted to allow Israel to cross over? ([it-1 782 ¶2-3](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/Insight-on-the-Scriptures/Exodus/#p63-p65))

It should be noted that, after reaching the second stage of their journey, Etham “at the edge of the wilderness,” God ordered Moses to “turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth . . . by the sea.” This maneuver would cause Pharaoh to believe the Israelites were “wandering in confusion.” (Ex 13:20; 14:1-3) Scholars favoring the el Haj route as the likely one point out that the Hebrew verb for “turn back” is emphatic and does not mean merely to “divert” or “turn aside,” but has more the sense of returning or at least of a marked detour. They suggest that, upon reaching a point N of the head of the Gulf of Suez, the Israelites reversed their line of march and went around to the E side of Jebel ʽAtaqah, a mountain range bordering the W side of the Gulf. A large host, such as the Israelites were, would find no effective way for swift exit from such a position if pursued from the N, and hence they would be bottled up with the sea blocking their way.

### “Stand Firm and See the Salvation of Jehovah”

**14:13, 14, 21, 22, 26-28** from [workbook August 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/august-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-3-9-2020/Stand-Firm-and-See-the-Salvation-of-Jehovah/)

Jehovah is a caring and considerate Savior. How did he show personal consideration for the Israelites during the Exodus from Egypt?

- He organized them.​—Ex 13:18
- He provided guidance and protection.​—Ex 14:19, 20
- He delivered all of his people, both young and old alike.​—Ex 14:29, 30

What confidence can you have as the great tribulation approaches?​—Isa 30:15


## Exodus 15

```
Moses and Israel’s victory song (1-19)
Miriam sings in response (20, 21)
Bitter water made sweet (22-27)
```

### Praise Jehovah in Song

**15:1, 2, 11, 18, 20, 21** from [workbook August 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/august-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-10-16-2020/Praise-Jehovah-in-Song/)

Music can have a powerful influence on the mind and body. Singing is an important part of our worship of Jehovah.

- Moses and the Israelites sang praises to Jehovah for their miraculous deliverance at the Red Sea
- King David assigned 4,000 men to serve as musicians and singers at the temple
- The night before Jesus died, he and his faithful apostles sang praises to Jehovah

What are some opportunities for me to sing praises to Jehovah?

## Exodus 16

```
People murmur about food (1-3)
Jehovah hears the murmurings (4-12)
Quail and manna provided (13-21)
No manna on the Sabbath (22-30)
Manna kept as a reminder (31-36)
```

#### Ex 16:13​—Why might Jehovah have chosen quail to feed the Israelites in the wilderness? ([w11 9/1 14](https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/wp20110901/Did-You-Know/#p2-p6))

▪ Following the Israelites’ Exodus from Egypt, God twice provided them with an abundance of meat in the form of quail.​—Exodus 16:13; Numbers 11:31.

Quail are small birds, about 7 inches (18 cm) in length and weighing about 3.5 ounces (100 g). They breed in many parts of western Asia and Europe. Being migratory birds, they winter in North Africa and Arabia. During their seasonal passage, vast flocks traverse the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea and fly over the Sinai Peninsula.

According to The New Westminster Dictionary of the Bible, quail “fly rapidly and well, and take advantage of the wind; but if the wind changes its course, or the birds become exhausted from long flight, the whole immense flock is apt to fall to the ground, where the birds lie stunned.” Before continuing their migration, they have to rest on the ground for a day or two, thus becoming easy catch for hunters. In the early 20th century, Egypt was exporting some three million quail annually for food.

Both times that the Israelites fed on quail were in the spring. Although quail regularly flew over the Sinai area during that time, it was Jehovah who caused ‘a wind to burst forth’ to drive these birds into the Israelite encampment.​—Numbers 11:31.

#### Ex 16:32-34​—Where was the jar of manna kept? ([w06 1/15 31](https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/w20060115/Questions-From-Readers/#p5))

Shortly after their deliverance from Egypt, the Israelites began to murmur about food. So Jehovah provided manna for them. (Exodus 12:17, 18; 16:1-5) At that time, Moses instructed Aaron: “Take a jar and put in it an omerful of manna and deposit it before Jehovah as something to be kept throughout your generations.” The account states: “Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, Aaron proceeded to deposit it before the Testimony [an archive for the safekeeping of important documents] as something to be kept.” (Exodus 16:33, 34) While Aaron undoubtedly gathered manna into a jar at that time, the depositing of it before the Testimony had to wait until Moses made the Ark and placed the tablets in it.

## Exodus 17

```
Complaint about lack of water at Horeb (1-4)
Water from a rock (5-7)
Amalekites’ attack and defeat (8-16)
```

#### Ex 17:11-13​—How can we imitate the decisive action of Aaron and Hur? (w16.09 6 ¶14)

Aaron and Hur literally supported Moses’ hands during a battle. As for us, we can look for ways to support and to give practical aid to others. To whom? To those battling the effects of old age, health limitations, opposition from their family, loneliness, or the loss of a loved one. We can also strengthen young ones who are facing pressure to share in wrongdoing or to seek “success” in this system of things, whether academically, financially, or professionally. (1 Thess. 3:1-3; 5:11, 14) Look for ways to show genuine interest in others at the Kingdom Hall, in the ministry, while enjoying a meal together, or as you converse on the telephone.

#### Ex 17:14​—Why are Moses’ writings part of the Bible canon? ([it-1 406](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/Insight-on-the-Scriptures/Canon/#p6))

That these writings of Moses were of divine origin, inspired of God, canonical, and a safe guideline for pure worship, there can be no doubt, in the light of internal evidence. It was not through Moses’ initiative that he became the leader and commander of the Israelites; at first Moses drew back at the suggestion. (Ex 3:10, 11; 4:10-14) Rather, God raised Moses up and invested in him such miraculous powers that even Pharaoh’s magic-practicing priests were compelled to acknowledge that what Moses did originated with God. (Ex 4:1-9; 8:16-19) So it was not Moses’ personal ambition to be an orator and writer. Rather, in obedience to God’s command and with the divine credentials of holy spirit, Moses was moved first to speak and then to write down part of the Bible canon.​—Ex 17:14.

## Exodus 18

```
Jethro and Zipporah arrive (1-12)
Jethro’s advice to appoint judges (13-27)
```

### Modest Men Train and Delegate

**18:17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25** from [workbook August 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/august-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-17-23-2020/Modest-Men-Train-and-Delegate/)

Experienced brothers show modesty, love, and foresight when they train younger ones and then delegate responsibility. How?

- Select those who have potential to take on more responsibility
- Clearly communicate what is required to complete a task
- Provide the funds, tools, or help that is needed
- Follow up on progress, and express trust in the student’s ability

ASK YOURSELF, ‘What responsibilities can I entrust to others?’

## Exodus 19

```
At Mount Sinai (1-25)
  Israel to be a kingdom of priests (5, 6)
  People sanctified to meet God (14, 15)
```

#### Ex 19:5, 6​—Why did ancient Israel lose the opportunity to become “a kingdom of priests”? (it-2 687 ¶1-2)

**The Christian Priesthood.** Jehovah had promised that if Israel kept his covenant they would become to Him “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” (Ex 19:6) However, the priesthood of Aaron’s line was to continue only until the coming of the greater priesthood that it foreshadowed. (Heb 8:4, 5) It would endure until the ending of the Law covenant and the inauguration of the new covenant. (Heb 7:11-14; 8:6, 7, 13) The offer was first made exclusively to Israel to become Jehovah’s priests serving in God’s promised Kingdom arrangement; in time this offer was extended to the Gentiles.​—Ac 10:34, 35; 15:14; Ro 10:21.

Only a remnant of the Jews accepted Christ, the nation thereby failing to provide the members of the *real* kingdom of priests and the holy nation. (Ro 11:7, 20) Because of Israel’s unfaithfulness God had forewarned them of this by his prophet Hosea centuries before, saying: “Because the knowledge is what you yourself have rejected, I shall also reject you from serving as a priest to me; and because you keep forgetting the law of your God, I shall forget your sons, even I.” (Ho 4:6) Correspondingly, Jesus told the Jewish leaders: “The kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits.” (Mt 21:43) Nevertheless, Jesus Christ, being under the Law while on earth, recognized the Aaronic priesthood as being in force, and he directed ones whom he cured of leprosy to go to the priest and make the required offering.​—Mt 8:4; Mr 1:44; Lu 17:14.

## Exodus 20

```
The Ten Commandments (1-17)
Spectacle causes Israel to fear (18-21)
Instructions about worship (22-26)
```

#### Ex 20:4, 5​—How does Jehovah bring “punishment for the error of fathers” upon future generations? (w04 3/15 27 ¶1)

After reaching an age of responsibility, each individual is judged on the basis of his own conduct and attitude. But when the nation of Israel turned to idolatry, it suffered the consequences of this for generations thereafter. Even the faithful Israelites felt its effects in that the nation’s religious delinquency made staying on a course of integrity difficult for them.

### The Ten Commandments and You

**20:3-17** from [workbook August 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/august-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-24-30-2020/The-Ten-Commandments-and-You/)

Christians are not under the Mosaic Law. (Col 2:13, 14) So, then, what purpose do the Ten Commandments and the rest of the Law serve today?

- They reveal Jehovah’s viewpoint on certain matters
- They highlight our responsibilities toward Jehovah
- They define our relationship with our fellowman

## Exodus 21

```
Judicial decisions for Israel (1-36)
  On Hebrew slaves (2-11)
  On violence done to a fellow man (12-27)
  On animals (28-36)
```

#### Ex 21:5, 6​—How do these verses illustrate the benefits of Christian dedication? (w10 1/15 4 ¶4-5)

Christian dedication is a serious matter. It is more than a mere commitment. How, though, does making a dedication benefit us? By way of comparison, let us consider how making a commitment in human relationships brings benefits. One example is friendship. To enjoy the privilege of having a friend, you have to accept the responsibility of being a friend. That involves a commitment​—you feel an obligation to care about your friend. One of the most outstanding friendships described in the Bible is that of David and Jonathan. They even made a covenant of friendship with each other. (Read 1 Samuel 17:57; 18:1, 3.) Although friendships with that level of commitment are rare, most friendships flourish when companions are committed, or feel some obligation, to each other.​—Prov. 17:17; 18:24.

The Law that God gave to Israel describes another relationship in which people benefited by making a commitment. If a slave wanted the security of belonging permanently to a good master, he could enter a permanent and binding agreement with him. The Law states: “If the slave should insistently say, ‘I really love my master, my wife and my sons; I do not want to go out as one set free,’ then his master must bring him near to the true God and must bring him up against the door or the doorpost; and his master must pierce his ear through with an awl, and he must be his slave to time indefinite.”​—Ex. 21:5, 6.

#### Ex 21:14​—How might this verse be explained? (it-1 1143)

The statement at Exodus 21:14 may mean that even a priest was to be executed for murder, or that the act of taking hold of the horns of the altar would not shield any willful murderer.​—Compare 1Ki 2:28-34.

### Reflect Jehovah’s View of Life

**21:20, 22, 23, 28, 29** from [workbook August 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/august-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-August-31-September-6-2020/Reflect-Jehovahs-View-of-Life/)

Jehovah views life as precious. How can we show that we share his view?

- Cultivate heartfelt love and respect for others.​—Mt 22:39; 1Jo 3:15
- Show such love by increasing your zeal in the ministry.​—1Co 9:22, 23; 2Pe 3:9
- Cultivate a proper attitude toward safety.​—Pr 22:3

## Exodus 22

```
Judicial decisions for Israel (1-31)
  On theft (1-4)
  On damages to crops (5, 6)
  On compensation and ownership (7-15)
  On seduction (16, 17)
  On worship and social justice (18-31)
```

## Exodus 23

```
Judicial decisions for Israel (1-19)
  On honest and just behavior (1-9)
  On sabbaths and festivals (10-19)
Angelic guidance for Israel (20-26)
Land acquisition and boundaries (27-33)
```

### Do Not Follow After the Crowd

**23:1-3** from [workbook September 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-7-13-2020/Do-Not-Follow-After-the-Crowd/)

Jehovah’s warning to witnesses and judges in legal cases not to be swayed by the crowd to give false testimony or render a perverted judgment also applies to other areas of life. Christians are under constant pressure to conform to this world’s ungodly thinking and conduct.​—Ro 12:2.

Why is it unwise to follow after the crowd when
- hearing unsubstantiated rumors or gossip?
- choosing clothing, hairstyles, or entertainment?
- thinking about and dealing with people of a different race, culture, or economic standing?

#### Ex 23:9​—How did Jehovah appeal to the Israelites’ empathy? (w16.10 9 ¶4)

Rather than order the Israelites to respect foreigners, Jehovah appealed to their empathy. (Read Exodus 23:9.) They knew ‘how it felt to be a foreigner.’ Even before they were reduced to slavery, the Hebrews were likely shunned by the Egyptians because of racial pride or religious prejudice. (Gen. 43:32; 46:34; Ex. 1:11-14) The Israelites had experienced a bitter life as foreign residents, but Jehovah expected them to treat the foreigner “like a native” among them.​—Lev. 19:33, 34.

**23:19; 34:26**​—What was the significance of the command not to boil a kid in its mother’s milk? Boiling a kid (the young of a goat or other animal) in its mother’s milk reportedly was a pagan ritual thought to produce rain. Moreover, since the mother’s milk is for nourishing her young, boiling her offspring in it would be an act of cruelty. This law helped to show God’s people that they should be compassionate.

#### Ex 23:20, 21​—What evidence supports the conclusion that the angel mentioned here is Michael? (it-2 393)

The only holy angel other than Gabriel named in the Bible, and the only one called “archangel.” (Jude 9) The first occurrence of the name is in the tenth chapter of Daniel, where Michael is described as “one of the foremost princes”; he came to the aid of a lesser angel who was opposed by “the prince of the royal realm of Persia.” Michael was called “the prince of [Daniel’s] people,” “the great prince who is standing in behalf of the sons of [Daniel’s] people.” (Da 10:13, 20, 21; 12:1) This points to Michael as the angel who led the Israelites through the wilderness. (Ex 23:20, 21, 23; 32:34; 33:2) Lending support to this conclusion is the fact that “Michael the archangel had a difference with the Devil and was disputing about Moses’ body.”​—Jude 9.

**23:20-23**​—*Who was the angel mentioned here, and how was it that Jehovah’s name was “within him”?* Likely, this angel was Jesus in his prehuman form. He was used to guide the Israelites on their way to the Promised Land. (1 Corinthians 10:1-4) Jehovah’s name is “within him” in that Jesus is the principal one who upholds and sanctifies his Father’s name.

## Exodus 24

```
People agree to keep the covenant (1-11)
Moses on Mount Sinai (12-18)
```

## Exodus 25

```
Contributions for the tabernacle (1-9)
The Ark (10-22)
The table (23-30)
The lampstand (31-40)
```

### The Central Object of the Tabernacle

**25:9, 21, 22** from [workbook September 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-14-20-2020/The-Central-Object-of-the-Tabernacle/)

The Ark was the most important object of the tabernacle and of the camp of Israel. God’s presence was represented by a cloud between the two cherubs over the propitiatory cover of the Ark. On the annual Day of Atonement, the high priest entered the Most Holy and spattered the blood of a bull and a goat before the cover to atone for Israel’s sins. (Le 16:14, 15) This foreshadowed the entrance of Jesus, the greater High Priest, into the very presence of Jehovah in heaven to present the value of his ransom sacrifice.​—Heb 9:24-26.

Match the following scriptures to the benefits available to us because of the ransom:

**SCRIPTURES**
- 1Jo 1:8, 9
- Heb 9:13, 14
- Ro 6:23

**BENEFITS**
- hope of living forever
- forgiveness of sins
- clean conscience

#### Ex 25:20​—What apparently was the significance of the way the cherubs were positioned on the cover of the Ark? (it-1 432 ¶1)

Representative figures of cherubs were included in the furnishings of the tabernacle set up in the wilderness. Rising above each end of the Ark’s cover were two cherubs of hammered gold. They were facing each other and bowing toward the cover in an attitude of worship. Each had two wings that spread upward and screened over the cover in a guarding and protecting manner. (Ex 25:10-21; 37:7-9) Also, the inner covering of tent cloths for the tabernacle and the curtain dividing the Holy from the Most Holy had embroidered cherub figures.​—Ex 26:1, 31; 36:8, 35.

#### Ex 25:30​—What was the showbread? (it-2 936)

Twelve cakes of bread that were placed on a table in the Holy compartment of the tabernacle or temple and that were replaced with fresh ones each Sabbath. (Ex 35:13; 39:36; 1Ki 7:48; 2Ch 13:11; Ne 10:32, 33) The literal Hebrew designation for the showbread is the “bread of the face.” The word for “face” sometimes denotes “presence” (2Ki 13:23), and so the showbread was in front of Jehovah’s face as an offering before him constantly. (Ex 25:30, ftn) The showbread is also referred to as “layer bread” (2Ch 2:4), “loaves of presentation” (Mr 2:26), and simply “the loaves” (Heb 9:2).

## Exodus 26

```
The tabernacle (1-37)
  The tent cloths (1-14)
  Panel frames and socket pedestals (15-30)
  The curtain and the screen (31-37)
```

## Exodus 27

```
Altar of burnt offering (1-8)
The courtyard (9-19)
Oil for the lampstand (20, 21)
```

## Exodus 28

```
Priestly garments (1-5)
The ephod (6-14)
The breastpiece (15-30)
  Urim and Thummim (30)
The sleeveless coat (31-35)
The turban with the golden plate (36-39)
Other priestly garments (40-43)
```

#### Ex 28:15-21​—Where did the precious stones on the breastpiece of Israel’s high priest possibly come from? (w12 8/1 26 ¶1-3)

After the Israelites left Egypt and entered the wilderness, God gave them orders to make this breastpiece. (Exodus 28:15-21) The breastpiece had stones of ruby, topaz, emerald, turquoise, sapphire, jasper, leshem, agate, amethyst, chrysolite, onyx, and jade. (Fn: It is difficult to identify all these stones according to modern terminology.) Did the Israelites really have access to those types of gems?

In Bible times, people prized precious stones and traded them. The ancient Egyptians, for example, obtained gemstones from as far away as what is now modern-day Iran, Afghanistan, and possibly even India. Egyptian mines produced a number of different precious stones. The Egyptian monarchs had a monopoly on mineral extraction in the territories they controlled. The patriarch Job described how his contemporaries used shafts and underground galleries to search for treasures. Among other items dug from the ground, sapphire and topaz are specifically mentioned by Job.​—Job 28:1-11, 19.

The Exodus account states that the Israelites “stripped the Egyptians” of their valuables when leaving the land. (Exodus 12:35, 36) So it is possible that the Israelites obtained from Egypt the stones used on the high priest’s breastpiece.

#### Ex 28:38​—What were “the holy things”? (it-1 1130 ¶2)

**Animals and Produce.** The firstborn males of cattle, sheep, and goats were counted as holy to Jehovah and were not to be redeemed. They were to be sacrificed, and a portion went to the sanctified priests. (Nu 18:17-19) The firstfruits and the tithe were holy, as were all sacrifices and all gifts sanctified to the service of the sanctuary. (Ex 28:38) All things holy to Jehovah were sacred and could not be considered lightly or used in a common, or profane, way. An example is the law regarding the tithe. If a man set aside the portion to be tithed, say, of his wheat crop, and then he or one of his household unintentionally took some of it for home use, such as cooking, the man was guilty of violating God’s law respecting holy things. The Law required that he make compensation to the sanctuary of an equal amount plus 20 percent, besides offering up a sound ram of the flock as a sacrifice. Thus, great respect was engendered for the holy things belonging to Jehovah.​—Le 5:14-16.

### What Can We Learn From the Priests’ Garments?

**28:30, 36, 42, 43**

The garments worn by Israel’s priests remind us of the importance of seeking Jehovah’s direction, of being holy, and of displaying modesty and dignity.

- How do we seek Jehovah’s direction?
- What does it mean to be holy?
- How can we display modesty and dignity?

## Exodus 29

```
Installation of priests (1-37)
The daily offering (38-46)
```

#### Ex 29:10​—What is the significance of the expression “lay their hands on the bull’s head”? (it-1 1029 ¶4)

**Laying On of Hands.** Aside from mere handling, *hands were laid on* a person or object for various purposes. The general meaning of the act, however, was that of a designation, a pointing out of the person or thing as being acknowledged, or recognized, in a certain way. During the ceremony at the installation of the priesthood, Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull and the two rams to be sacrificed, thereby acknowledging that these animals were being sacrificed for them for the sake of their becoming priests of Jehovah God. (Ex 29:10, 15, 19; Le 8:14, 18, 22) When appointing Joshua as his successor at God’s command, Moses laid his hand on Joshua, who consequently was “full of the spirit of wisdom” and so was able to lead Israel properly. (De 34:9) Hands were laid on persons when designating them as receivers of a blessing. (Ge 48:14; Mr 10:16) Jesus Christ touched, or laid his hands on, some persons he healed. (Mt 8:3; Mr 6:5; Lu 13:13) The gift of the holy spirit was granted in some instances through the laying on of the hands of the apostles.​—Ac 8:14-20; 19:6.

## Exodus 30

```
Incense altar (1-10)
Census and money for atonement (11-16)
Copper basin for washing (17-21)
Special mixture of anointing oil (22-33)
Holy incense formula (34-38)
```

#### Ex 30:31-33​—Why was it a capital offense to make holy anointing oil and to put it on an unauthorized person? (it-1 114 ¶1)

In the Law Jehovah gave to Moses, he prescribed a formula for the anointing oil. It was of a special composition of the choicest ingredients​—myrrh, sweet cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil. (Ex 30:22-25) It was a capital offense for anyone to compound this mixture and to use it for any common or unauthorized purpose. (Ex 30:31-33) This figuratively demonstrated the importance and sacredness of an appointment to office that had been confirmed by anointing with sacred oil.

### A Contribution to Jehovah

**30:11-16** from [workbook September 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/september-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-September-28-October-4-2020/A-Contribution-to-Jehovah/)

When the tabernacle was constructed, individuals had the privilege of contributing financially to support Jehovah’s worship, regardless of whether they were rich or poor. How can we make a contribution to Jehovah today? One way is by financially supporting Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls, remote translation offices, and Bethel complexes, as well as other buildings that are dedicated to the worship of Jehovah.

What do we learn from the following scriptures about making financial contributions to support true worship?

- 1Ch 29:5
- Mr 12:43, 44
- 1Co 16:2

## Exodus 31

```
Craftsmen filled with God’s spirit (1-11)
Sabbath, a sign between God and Israel (12-17)
The two stone tablets (18)
```

#### Ex 31:17​—In what sense has Jehovah rested on the seventh creative day? (w19.12 3 ¶4)

Do the examples set by Jehovah and Jesus in working hard imply that it is not necessary for us to rest? Not at all. Jehovah never gets tired, so he does not need physical rest. The Bible does say that after Jehovah created the heavens and the earth, “he rested and refreshed himself.” (Ex. 31:17) However, that evidently means that Jehovah paused and found satisfaction in what he had made. And although Jesus worked hard while he lived on earth, he still made time to rest and to enjoy meals with his friends.​—Matt. 14:13; Luke 7:34.

## Exodus 32

```
Worship of the golden calf (1-35)
  Moses hears strange singing (17, 18)
  Moses smashes the law tablets (19)
  Levites loyal to Jehovah (26-29)
```

**32:1-8, 25-35**​—Why was Aaron not punished for making the golden calf? Aaron was not in heartfelt sympathy with the idolatry. Later, he apparently joined fellow Levites in taking a stand for God and against those who resisted Moses. After the guilty were slain, Moses reminded the people that they had sinned greatly, indicating that others besides Aaron also received Jehovah’s mercy.

#### Ex 32:32, 33​—How do we know that “once saved, always saved” is a false teaching? (w87 9/1 29)

A person’s being noted with remembrance and approval (having his name “in the book of life”) does not mean that he is guaranteed eternal life, as if this were predestined or unchangeable. Concerning the Israelites, Moses asked Jehovah: “Now if you will pardon their sin,​—and if not, wipe me out, please, from your book that you have written.” God replied: “Whoever has sinned against me, I shall wipe him out of my book.” (Exodus 32:32, 33) Yes, even after God listed someone with approval in his “book,” the individual could become disobedient or abandon his faith. If that developed, God would “blot out his name from the book of life.”​—Revelation 3:5.

### Flee From Idolatry

**32:1, 4-6, 9, 10** from [workbook October 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/october-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-5-11-2020/Flee-From-Idolatry/)

The Israelites’ view of idol worship had apparently been influenced by Egyptian thinking. Today, idolatry can take many forms, some of which could be hard to recognize. Although we might not turn to outright idol worship, we could become idolaters by allowing selfish desires to distract us from worshipping Jehovah whole-souled.

## Exodus 33

```
God’s message of reproof (1-6)
Tent of meeting outside the camp (7-11)
Moses asks to see Jehovah’s glory (12-23)
```

#### Ex 33:11, 20​—How did God speak to Moses “face-to-face”? (w04 3/15 27 ¶5)

This expression denotes intimate two-way conversation. Moses talked with God’s representative and orally received instruction from Jehovah through him. But Moses did not see Jehovah, since ‘no man can see God and yet live.’ In fact, Jehovah did not personally speak to Moses. The Law “was transmitted through angels by the hand of a mediator,” states Galatians 3:19.

## Exodus 34

```
New stone tablets prepared (1-4)
Moses sees Jehovah’s glory (5-9)
Details of the covenant repeated (10-28)
Moses’ face emits rays (29-35)
```

#### Ex 34:23, 24​—Why did Israelite men need faith to attend the three annual festivals? (w98 9/1 20 ¶5)

Three times a year every male Israelite and proselyte in the land was commanded to appear before Jehovah. Realizing that the entire family would benefit spiritually from such occasions, many family heads arranged for their wife and children to accompany them. But who would protect their homes and their fields from enemy attack while the family was away? Jehovah promised: “Nobody will desire your land while you are going up to see the face of Jehovah your God three times in the year.” (Exodus 34:24) It took faith for the Israelites to believe that if they put spiritual interests first, they would not lose out materially. Did Jehovah prove true to his word? He certainly did!

### Jehovah’s Endearing Qualities

**34:5-7** from [workbook October 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/october-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-12-18-2020/Jehovahs-Endearing-Qualities/)

Appreciation for Jehovah’s qualities helped Moses to deal patiently with the Israelites. Similarly, if we deepen our understanding of Jehovah’s qualities, we can deal mercifully with fellow believers.

- **“Merciful and compassionate”:** Jehovah looks after his worshippers with tender love and deep concern, just as parents look after their children
- **“Slow to anger”:** Jehovah is patient with his servants, putting up with their shortcomings and giving them time to make changes
- **“Abundant in loyal love”:** Jehovah forges an unfailing bond of loyal love with his people

## Exodus 35

```
Sabbath instructions (1-3)
Contributions for the tabernacle (4-29)
Bezalel and Oholiab filled with spirit (30-35)
```

#### Ex 35:1-3​—What can we learn from the Sabbath law? (w05 5/15 23 ¶14)

*Give priority to spiritual matters.* The nation of Israel was not to allow caring for physical needs to crowd out attention given to spiritual activities. The Israelites’ lives were not to be devoted solely to mundane pursuits. Jehovah set aside time each week that he designated as sacred, time used exclusively for activity related to worship of the true God. (Exodus 35:1-3; Numbers 15:32-36) Each year, additional time was to be set aside for specified holy conventions. (Leviticus 23:4-44) These would provide opportunities to recount Jehovah’s mighty acts, to be reminded of his ways, and to express gratitude to him for all of his goodness. As the people expressed their devotion to Jehovah, they would grow in godly fear and love and would be helped to walk in his ways. (Deuteronomy 10:12, 13) The wholesome principles embodied in those instructions benefit Jehovah’s servants today.​—Hebrews 10:24, 25.

#### Ex 35:21​—How is the generous spirit of the Israelites an excellent example for us? (w00 11/1 29 ¶1)

Imagine, then, how the Israelites felt. Generations had suffered through bitter slavery and deprivation. Now they were free and had rich material possessions. How would they feel about parting with some of those possessions? They might have felt that they had earned them and had a right to keep them. However, when called upon to contribute financially to support pure worship, they did so​—and not reluctantly or stingily! They did not forget that Jehovah had made it possible for them to have those material things. Thus, they gave abundantly of their silver and gold and livestock. They were “willing-hearted.” Their ‘hearts impelled them.’ ‘Their spirit incited them.’ It truly was “a voluntary offering to Jehovah.”​—Exodus 25:1-9; 35:4-9, 20-29; 36:3-7.

### Equipped to Do Jehovah’s Work

**35:25, 26, 30-35; 36:1, 2** from [workbook October 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/october-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-19-25-2020/Equipped-to-Do-Jehovahs-Work/)

Jehovah’s holy spirit equipped Bezalel and Oholiab to carry out the detailed plans for the tabernacle. Jehovah’s powerful holy spirit is also available to his servants today. How can we benefit from it?

- We must pray for holy spirit to heighten any abilities we have in Jehovah’s service
- We must diligently feed on God’s inspired Word
- We should pour our heart into any assignment we are given

## Exodus 36

```

```

## Exodus 37

```

```

#### Ex 37:1, 10, 25​—Why was acacia wood a fine building material for the tabernacle? (it-1 36)

The acacia has many long thorns extending out from the widely spreading branches. These branches usually interlace with those of the neighboring acacias to form tangled thickets; this fact doubtless explains why the plural form *shit·timʹ* is almost always used in the Bible record. The acacia may grow to heights of 6 to 8 m (20 to 26 ft), but often is bushlike in appearance. It has soft, feathery leaves and is covered with pleasingly fragrant yellow blossoms, producing curved tapering pods as its fruit. The rough, black bark covers a very hard, fine-grained, heavy wood that is immune to insect attack. These characteristics and its availability in the desert made the acacia especially well suited as a building material for the tabernacle and its furnishings. It was employed to construct the ark of the covenant (Ex 25:10; 37:1), the table of showbread (Ex 25:23; 37:10), altars (Ex 27:1; 37:25; 38:1), poles for carrying these items (Ex 25:13, 28; 27:6; 30:5; 37:4, 15, 28; 38:6), pillars for the curtain and screen (Ex 26:32, 37; 36:36), and the panel frames (Ex 26:15; 36:20) and their connecting bars (Ex 26:26; 36:31).

### Tabernacle Altars and Their Role in True Worship

**37:25, 29; 38:1** from [workbook October 2020](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/october-2020-mwb/Life-and-Ministry-Meeting-Schedule-for-October-26-November-1-2020/Tabernacle-Altars-and-Their-Role-in-True-Worship/)

The tabernacle altars were built according to Jehovah’s instructions and had special significance.

**The incense altar.** - Like the burning of skillfully blended incense, acceptable prayers offered up by Jehovah’s servants are pleasing to him

**The altar of burnt offering.** - Jehovah accepted sacrifices made on the altar of burnt offering. Its location in front of the sanctuary reminds us that faith in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus is necessary for acceptance by God.​—Joh 3:16-18; Heb 10:5-10

## Exodus 38

```
The altar of burnt offering (1-7)
The copper basin (8)
The courtyard (9-20)
Inventory of tabernacle materials (21-31)
```

#### Ex 38:8​—How did ancient mirrors differ from those commonly used today? (w15 4/1 15 ¶4)

Unlike the glass mirrors of today, mirrors in Bible times were generally made of metal that was highly polished—usually bronze, but possibly also copper, silver, gold, or electrum. The first mention of mirrors in the Bible is in connection with the construction of the tabernacle, Israel’s first center of worship. Women contributed mirrors for the fabrication of a sacred copper basin and its stand. (Exodus 38:8) Presumably, the mirrors would have to be melted down to be used for that purpose.
